# Kittu LLM

This is an ongoing project of mine where I am trying to build an LLM that mimics my texting voice - because there's lots of testing data ðŸ™‚

# Requirements

For now Python, but in the future there will also be a react app component.

Initialize a virtual environment and run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all necessary libraries without conflicts.
