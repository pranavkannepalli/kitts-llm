[2/4/23, 6:00:51 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: Hello Krishna Uncle. This is Pranav. My dad sent your contact to me. I was just wondering what time you are available to meet tomorrow. Anytime after 10 am should work for me.
[2/5/23, 10:28:43 AM] Pranav Kannepalli: Hello again 👋. Just following up on the previous message.
[2/19/23, 6:21:59 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: https://www.kaggle.com/pranavkannepalli/cifarprecisionpredictor
[2/19/23, 6:22:02 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: Hi Krishna Uncle
[2/19/23, 6:23:33 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: * This is what I've made so far. It was overfitting so I doubled the dataset size, added a dropout, and also added early stopping so it doesn't keep going. It's achieving about 66% percent accuracy right now.
[2/19/23, 6:26:11 PM] Krishna Chintalapudi: I am in Florida pranav. Can we chat once I come back. What architectures did you try for the classifier.
[2/19/23, 6:26:36 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: I tried a convolutional neural network
[2/19/23, 6:26:56 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: Yeah, we can schedule a time once you're back
[2/19/23, 6:28:00 PM] Krishna Chintalapudi: What was you test set accuracy on the classifier.
[2/19/23, 6:28:26 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: Test set accuracy was about 66% percent while the train set was 71% before it stopped
[2/19/23, 6:28:54 PM] Krishna Chintalapudi: Hmm.... Ok let's chat when I come back.
[2/19/23, 6:29:14 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: Ok 👍
[2/19/23, 6:30:49 PM] Krishna Chintalapudi: Mnist is an easy one. You get 98 percent easily. Try different architectures meanwhile.
[2/19/23, 6:30:59 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: No for the second model
[2/19/23, 6:31:04 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: Sorry that’s my bad
[2/19/23, 6:31:51 PM] Krishna Chintalapudi: What are you getting for the main classifier.
[2/19/23, 6:32:08 PM] Krishna Chintalapudi: Not the accuracy predictor.
[2/19/23, 6:32:35 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: For the main classifier I tried to keep it around 50% on purpose so that it would just return 1 everything for the accuracy predictor
[2/19/23, 6:33:09 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: Also I tried with the cifar 10 dataset because no matter what I was doing it was too accurate
[2/19/23, 6:33:26 PM] Krishna Chintalapudi: Ok. Let's chat when I get back.
[2/19/23, 6:33:54 PM] Krishna Chintalapudi: Cifar10 is a tougher one. Ok.
[2/19/23, 6:33:56 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: 👍🏽 I’ll keep toying around with the accuracy predictor in the meantime
[2/19/23, 6:34:46 PM] Krishna Chintalapudi: Cool.
[2/25/23, 12:28:10 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: Hi Krishna Uncle, just checking to see if you’re available to meet anytime soon.
[2/25/23, 12:28:34 PM] Krishna Chintalapudi: Tomorrow? Not back yet.
[2/25/23, 12:29:01 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: Preferably not tomorrow (it’s my birthday so I’ll be out), but any day after that should mostly work
[2/25/23, 12:30:23 PM] Krishna Chintalapudi: Aah happy birthday!!
[2/25/23, 12:30:35 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: Thank you!
[2/25/23, 12:31:12 PM] Krishna Chintalapudi: Ok. Do you know about data augmentation?
[2/25/23, 12:32:03 PM] Krishna Chintalapudi: If not read up. It helps a lot.
[2/25/23, 12:32:15 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: Yes, I used it on the last project to add more data
[2/25/23, 12:32:30 PM] Krishna Chintalapudi: Cool. Which project.
[2/25/23, 12:32:54 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: The one that you gave me about predicting the accuracy of a second neural network
[2/25/23, 12:33:09 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: It was overfitting so I was trying to fix that
[2/25/23, 12:33:17 PM] Krishna Chintalapudi: Cool.
[2/25/23, 12:34:36 PM] Krishna Chintalapudi: One thing I have been thinking is to not use a separate network for the predictor. Rather, use the features from the conv layer just before the fully connected layer as input.
[2/25/23, 12:35:48 PM] Krishna Chintalapudi: The reasonable ng us that the classifier has already done the heavy lifting of creation ng potentially linearly sepetable features.
[2/25/23, 12:36:28 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: Ic.
[2/25/23, 12:36:31 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: Maybe I’ll try that
[2/25/23, 12:37:21 PM] Krishna Chintalapudi: The whole idea of deep nets is that, all the layers before the fully connected layer map input to a linearly sepetable features set.
[2/25/23, 12:37:57 PM] Krishna Chintalapudi: The final layer basically a perception or a standard 1 layer mlp can then classify.
[2/25/23, 12:38:26 PM] Krishna Chintalapudi: The effectiveness of the deep net depends on the effectiveness of the features created.
[2/25/23, 12:38:41 PM] Krishna Chintalapudi: Before the fully connected layers.
[2/25/23, 12:39:17 PM] Krishna Chintalapudi: So it makes sense to use those features as I put to the predictor
[2/25/23, 12:39:26 PM] Krishna Chintalapudi: Instead of the image
[2/25/23, 12:39:54 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: Wait so how would implement this?
[2/25/23, 12:40:25 PM] Krishna Chintalapudi: You would first train. A standard classifier.
[2/25/23, 12:40:31 PM] Krishna Chintalapudi: Just as you did.
[2/25/23, 12:41:14 PM] Krishna Chintalapudi: Then take the output tensor from the layer before the fully connected layer as the input vector for the predictor.
[2/25/23, 12:41:22 PM] Krishna Chintalapudi: Instead of the images
[2/25/23, 12:41:29 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: Yeah makes sense
[2/25/23, 12:41:39 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: Okay I’ll try that
[2/25/23, 12:41:45 PM] Krishna Chintalapudi: So suppose you have image I
[2/25/23, 12:42:11 PM] Krishna Chintalapudi: For each image record the tensor.
[2/25/23, 12:42:14 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: Yeah for image I make the prediction of what image it is and asscociate that with a set of features
[2/25/23, 12:42:34 PM] Krishna Chintalapudi: Yea.
[2/25/23, 12:42:51 PM] Krishna Chintalapudi: What's the tensor size?
[2/25/23, 12:42:55 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: Then use that dataset of features with predictions to train the last model
[2/25/23, 12:43:03 PM] Krishna Chintalapudi: Yea.
[2/25/23, 12:43:40 PM] Krishna Chintalapudi: The network can be a simple perceptron or an mlp
[2/25/23, 12:44:00 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: Ok
[2/25/23, 12:45:24 PM] Krishna Chintalapudi: You said you are trying Cifar 10 and mnist right?
[2/25/23, 12:45:28 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: Yes
[2/25/23, 12:45:33 PM] Krishna Chintalapudi: There is also a fashion mnist.
[2/25/23, 12:45:51 PM] Krishna Chintalapudi: It's in between interns of complexity.
[2/25/23, 12:45:56 PM] Krishna Chintalapudi: Ok.
[2/25/23, 12:46:19 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: Oh I see
[2/25/23, 12:46:27 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: I found it on kaggle
[2/25/23, 12:46:36 PM] Krishna Chintalapudi: Cool.
[2/25/23, 12:46:40 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: Ok thank you
[2/25/23, 12:47:13 PM] Krishna Chintalapudi: Cifar 100 is a tough one. Then there is the image net and it's subsets
[2/25/23, 12:47:42 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: Yeah, it has 100 different classes instead of 10 right
[2/25/23, 12:48:01 PM] Krishna Chintalapudi: We can start with cifar10 fashion mnist and mnist.
[2/25/23, 12:48:06 PM] Krishna Chintalapudi: Then move up.
[2/25/23, 12:48:09 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: 👍🏽
[2/26/23, 5:11:37 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: Hi Krishna uncle, I implemented it using the features. Here's the Kaggle notebook for it: https://www.kaggle.com/code/pranavkannepalli/cifarprecisionwfeatures/notebook?scriptVersionId=120431418
[2/26/23, 5:11:57 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: Right now its with CIFAR 10, although I can switch it to any other dataset pretty easily
[3/8/23, 9:36:20 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: Hi Krishna Uncle, its been a busy couple weeks since the last time I texted you.
[3/8/23, 9:36:26 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: Could we schedule a time to meet?
[3/9/23, 4:23:44 AM] Krishna Chintalapudi: Sure. How about this Saturday?
[3/9/23, 6:50:35 AM] Pranav Kannepalli: I’ll have to check, what time were you thinking?
[3/9/23, 7:49:59 AM] Krishna Chintalapudi: Or Sunday.
[3/9/23, 7:50:15 AM] Krishna Chintalapudi: Tell me your free times on both days.
[3/10/23, 6:38:04 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: Sry for the late response
[3/10/23, 6:38:10 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: I think I’m free all day tomorrow
[3/10/23, 10:32:27 PM] Krishna Chintalapudi: Ok.
[3/11/23, 11:47:18 AM] Pranav Kannepalli: Are you free today Krishna uncle?
