[4/20/24, 6:53:03 PM] Karma Ibrahim: I’m not going to nats because I’m traveling to Egypt during that time
[4/20/24, 6:53:50 PM] Karma Ibrahim: we need to emphasize the format that submissions need to be in. I know like 4 times that got disqualified because they submitted a word doc instead of a pdf
[4/20/24, 6:56:58 PM] Sanjana: ok bruh this is annoying though bc I thought it says submit as pdf on the platform
[4/20/24, 7:07:42 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : yeah it says upload pdf
[4/20/24, 7:07:49 PM] Karma Ibrahim: yeah sometimes it’s not clear which is so annoying
[4/20/24, 7:08:08 PM] Chin Chin: I think in general, we can make better use of meetings during lunch
[4/20/24, 7:08:14 PM] Chin Chin: for example, showing them an example submission
[4/20/24, 7:08:21 PM] Karma Ibrahim: but I think if this many teams got disqualified because of that then we definitely have to emphasize it
[4/20/24, 7:08:26 PM] Karma Ibrahim: yeah exactly
[4/20/24, 7:36:29 PM] Iris Dey: Yeah we can use one of our portfolios too and compare it to the rubric and what we got
[4/20/24, 7:36:57 PM] Chin Chin: i think we should start some sort of document for ideas we have
[4/20/24, 7:37:02 PM] Chin Chin: for next year
[4/20/24, 7:37:05 PM] Iris Dey: Okie dokes

[5/12/24, 11:59:59 AM] Iris Dey: The fonts weird 😭
[5/12/24, 10:18:22 PM] Karma Ibrahim: maybe for color scheme use the school colors instead of black and white
[5/12/24, 10:19:27 PM] Karma Ibrahim: it’s a little thick but keep playing around with the fonts
[5/17/24, 9:00:14 PM] Iris Dey: Should I do a post Abt early submissions for nats on insta

[5/17/24, 9:32:17 PM] Iris Dey: should i do a second slide showing what events have early submissions
[5/17/24, 9:32:18 PM] Chin Chin: this might confuse some people into thinking that the submission is in 40 days
[5/17/24, 9:32:22 PM] Iris Dey: oh
[5/17/24, 9:32:23 PM] Iris Dey: yeah
[5/17/24, 9:32:55 PM] Chin Chin: maybe put the fact that there are 5 days left in early submission in big letters
[5/17/24, 9:33:04 PM] Chin Chin: and then the nats thing in small legters
[5/17/24, 9:33:04 PM] Iris Dey: kk

[5/18/24, 1:08:41 PM] Iris Dey: @14256285458 what would be a good price range for merch
[5/18/24, 1:09:03 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: oh yeah shruthika u might have to check how much we have left in our budget
[5/18/24, 1:09:07 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: shouldn't matter
[5/18/24, 1:09:17 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: and how much we acc have in the bank to spend
[5/18/24, 1:09:36 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: prob up to 50?
[5/18/24, 1:09:41 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: idk if people will buy if its higher
[5/18/24, 1:09:48 PM] Sanjana: nah I don’t think people are gonna spend 50
[5/18/24, 1:09:53 PM] Iris Dey: its a shirt
[5/18/24, 1:09:57 PM] Iris Dey: no one is spending 50
[5/18/24, 1:10:02 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: oh i thought it was a hoodie
[5/18/24, 1:10:02 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: mb
[5/18/24, 1:10:20 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: 25 max?
[5/18/24, 1:10:24 PM] Iris Dey: okok
[5/18/24, 1:10:44 PM] Iris Dey: its currently going to 19 smth but im not done with the final design
[5/18/24, 1:10:56 PM] Sanjana: another thing: eastlake prez is my friend + he brought up the idea of having a regional competition, would be a place for ppl to test out their projects and also get the intraschool competition out of the way. i’ll send some more details - it’ll be early december probably and at Eastlake
[5/18/24, 1:10:58 PM] Iris Dey: it should stay the same price tho
[5/18/24, 1:11:23 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: yeah thats a good price
[5/18/24, 1:11:30 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: wait ong that would be great tho
[5/18/24, 1:31:40 PM] Sanjana: ok perfect i'll tell him! he was thinking Eastlake board + stem board could be judges
[5/18/24, 1:32:24 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : Oh you’re right that would be nice
[5/18/24, 1:32:54 PM] Chin Chin: by intraschool competition do you mean like two teams from our school competing for an event?
[5/18/24, 1:32:59 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : I have to check because I’m trying to see if we can get express passes for universal 😭
[5/18/24, 1:33:28 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : Because otherwise we wouldn’t be able to get anything there
[5/18/24, 1:33:29 PM] Sanjana: yup yup
[5/18/24, 1:33:38 PM] Sanjana: oh lord
[5/18/24, 1:33:43 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : I don’t know if I’d like a competition but feedback fs
[5/18/24, 1:33:51 PM] Chin Chin: my only concern with that is timing
[5/18/24, 1:33:51 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : Cuz I think competition would make tsa too stressful
[5/18/24, 1:34:19 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : Like if one person got better than another they’d probably stress a lot trying to do more than each other
[5/18/24, 1:34:22 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : Idk
[5/18/24, 1:34:26 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : It sounds good though
[5/18/24, 1:35:02 PM] Chin Chin: because if we use a competition to decide who gets the event, we need to give them enough time to build something that represents their ability. However, at the same time people need to know what their final events are early, so that they can start working on them for Jan 11th
[5/18/24, 1:36:15 PM] Sanjana: hmm okay that makes sense - what if we adjusted it so it was more of a practice round before jan 11? or alternatively we have it after jan 11….?
[5/18/24, 1:36:48 PM] Chin Chin: i think the Eastlake-tesla competition is really good for feedback, but not very good for intraschool
[5/18/24, 1:37:26 PM] Chin Chin: and most of the time, with scheduling and stuff, it rarely ends up that two teams are equally fit for the event
[5/18/24, 1:38:13 PM] Chin Chin: usually, even if there are two teams applying for the event, one team will have more people that have just 1 event or sm, in which case the event goes to them
[5/18/24, 1:39:15 PM] Chin Chin: Most of tsa teams do a bulk of their work after jan 11th
[5/18/24, 1:39:33 PM] Chin Chin: so I feel more inclined towards doing something in like mid/end feb
[5/18/24, 1:40:01 PM] Chin Chin: to give them enough time to work on actionable feedback while having something to show
[5/18/24, 1:40:27 PM] Chin Chin: and to motivate them, we can make the competition ranked, so we give 1st, 2nd, and 3rd with some certificates or sm
[5/18/24, 1:45:56 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: mhm
[5/18/24, 1:45:58 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: yeah that sounds better
[5/18/24, 1:46:06 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: like closer to the actual conference
[5/18/24, 1:46:25 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : Yeah makes sense
[5/18/24, 1:46:40 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: but still with 2-3 weeks before so they have time to implement feedback
[5/18/24, 1:47:00 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: idk if we should do this either
[5/18/24, 1:47:04 PM] Sanjana: state is first week of April next year so i think middle of feb is good bc march will be rough for a lot of ppl
[5/18/24, 1:47:07 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : On TSA??
[5/18/24, 1:47:16 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: scroll down
[5/18/24, 1:47:23 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : Yeah let me check with fbla
[5/18/24, 1:47:27 PM] Sanjana: yup that was the plan
[5/18/24, 1:47:51 PM] Chin Chin: why not
[5/18/24, 1:49:04 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : Oh FBLA merch is $35
[5/18/24, 1:49:14 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: for a shirt?
[5/18/24, 1:49:17 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: or a hoodie?
[5/18/24, 1:49:19 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : Who exactly is willing to pay that for TSA though
[5/18/24, 1:49:27 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : Probably let me ask her
[5/18/24, 1:49:32 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: 🙋🏽‍♂️
[5/18/24, 1:50:46 PM] Chin Chin: quarter zip
[5/18/24, 1:51:12 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: yeah thats what i thought
[5/18/24, 1:52:06 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : Oh okok
[5/19/24, 9:05:44 AM] Karma Ibrahim: That’s such a good idea because I know so many people that were comparing how fbla regionals really prepared them for state and how they wanted a way to test out projects before states for tsa as well
[5/19/24, 9:08:26 AM] Karma Ibrahim: then would we require all students to participate or just those who want to?
[5/19/24, 9:32:30 AM] Iris Dey: Just who wants too
[5/19/24, 9:32:54 AM] Iris Dey: And also some comps might be hard to like actually do physically
[5/19/24, 9:32:57 AM] Iris Dey: Like vex
[5/19/24, 9:33:00 AM] Iris Dey: Dragster
[5/19/24, 9:34:42 AM] Sanjana: eastlake has a big gym, dragster wouldn’t be too bad
[5/19/24, 9:34:52 AM] Sanjana: we probably couldn’t do vex though
[5/19/24, 9:36:13 AM] Iris Dey: Unless one team is willing to bring their field in which is probably a no
[5/19/24, 9:39:27 AM] Iris Dey: Also the judges should judge events they don't do right
[5/19/24, 9:39:41 AM] Iris Dey: Cuz it feel like it would be awkward looking at other teams things
[5/19/24, 9:39:49 AM] Iris Dey: That ur competing with
[5/19/24, 10:12:30 AM] Karma Ibrahim: I feel like it would be fine. I didn’t do vex but I judged at state because they provide you with the rubric and everything
[5/19/24, 10:13:07 AM] Chin Chin: we can talk to exo
[5/19/24, 10:13:15 AM] Chin Chin: it's a local robotics club that hosts a lot of events
[5/19/24, 10:13:24 AM] Chin Chin: I can dm the manager, Kevin <This message was edited>
[5/19/24, 10:13:58 AM] Chin Chin: they should be able to provide us with a field and volunteers to run skills and matches
[5/19/24, 10:14:01 AM] Pranav Kannepalli: yeah it’s not that bad to judge
[5/19/24, 10:14:07 AM] Pranav Kannepalli: esp with people who know how it works around
[5/19/24, 10:24:21 AM] Iris Dey: Okay yeah
[5/19/24, 10:25:16 AM] Iris Dey: If we do this we should make a Eastlake x Tesla board gc early next September <This message was edited>
[5/19/24, 10:26:13 AM] Karma Ibrahim: yes with the board
[5/19/24, 10:26:34 AM] Karma Ibrahim: But we’ll probably have to get permission first before we can start planning
[5/19/24, 10:27:13 AM] Iris Dey: True
[5/19/24, 10:28:42 AM] Pranav Kannepalli: mhm
[5/19/24, 10:31:00 AM] Iris Dey: Kank would love the idea tho
[5/19/24, 10:32:50 AM] Pranav Kannepalli: yeah she would
[5/19/24, 10:33:16 AM] Pranav Kannepalli: we have to get all the logistics cranked out at the start of next year
[5/19/24, 10:33:22 AM] Pranav Kannepalli: and then get permissions to host the event
[5/19/24, 11:05:13 AM] Shruthika Balasubramania : Yeah that sounds rly cool
[5/19/24, 2:01:13 PM] Karma Ibrahim: would we want to host it? or do it at Eastlake because their schools bigger
[5/19/24, 2:02:35 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: prob at eastlake
[5/19/24, 4:20:42 PM] Iris Dey: also we should add cleo and pallavi

[5/26/24, 11:33:22 PM] Sanjana: oh fab we can just demand them back then

[6/7/24, 2:14:52 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : So that means we have to put a form out, get confirmed orders, have them pay, then we order
[6/7/24, 2:15:41 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : She recommended a local merch company named inkcredible or smth so we’ll probably look into that for quick delivery

[8/14/24, 11:20:24 AM] Karma Ibrahim: yesss iris the design looks good
[8/14/24, 12:09:59 PM] Chin Chin: Sorry for the late chime in. Do you guys think we should use a bigger font and lesser text?
[8/14/24, 12:10:07 PM] Chin Chin: considering people are just going to be passing by
[8/14/24, 12:10:55 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : Maybe a bit bigger text? Maybe the regional state and national level line can be condensed
[8/14/24, 12:17:24 PM] Iris Dey: yeah
[8/14/24, 12:17:41 PM] Iris Dey: its gonna look bigger on a 36 x 48 poster
[8/14/24, 12:18:22 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : True
[8/14/24, 12:22:24 PM] Chin Chin: I feel like a lot of this stuff needs to be said by us
[8/14/24, 12:22:35 PM] Chin Chin: and the poster should just be there for them quickly understand the key points
[8/14/24, 12:22:40 PM] Iris Dey: yeah okok
[8/14/24, 12:22:45 PM] Iris Dey: ill change in a bit
[8/14/24, 12:22:55 PM] Chin Chin: yeah take your time
[8/14/24, 1:10:01 PM] Cleo Balaranjith: Yeah like what is the competition is kind of small
[8/14/24, 1:10:20 PM] Cleo Balaranjith: U shud decrease the size of the title
[8/14/24, 3:20:24 PM] Iris Dey: Kk
[8/14/24, 4:25:23 PM] Iris Dey: image omitted
[8/14/24, 4:42:54 PM] Chin Chin: I like this a lot better
[8/14/24, 4:43:02 PM] Iris Dey: Okie
[8/14/24, 4:45:39 PM] Chin Chin: Couple things tho:
- The first bullet point can simply say: "40+ STEM-based competitive events", since the rest of the words are pretty redundant.
- Second bullet point is perfect.
- Could we think about adding this as a date to the list of dates for competitions, like "Sign up for events - September 20th" or sm like that? Might be more effective.
- 4th bullet point is also great.
- I think we should increase the size of the "Thursdays at lunch" to be a lot bigger, since most parents want to sign their freshman kids up for as many clubs as possible, and from what I've seen last year, the first question they ask is when the club's meetings are.
[8/14/24, 4:45:57 PM] Iris Dey: Kk
[8/14/24, 4:46:49 PM] Chin Chin: Thank you iris
[8/14/24, 4:50:09 PM] Iris Dey: image omitted
[8/14/24, 4:50:43 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : that looks nice do you want to increase  the line spacing a little bit in the middle?
[8/14/24, 4:50:45 PM] Chin Chin: We don't know yet if we are going to announce events by September 20th actually
[8/14/24, 4:50:52 PM] Chin Chin: could we just say end of September?
[8/14/24, 4:51:28 PM] Iris Dey: Kk
[8/14/24, 4:53:18 PM] Iris Dey: image omitted
[8/14/24, 4:55:36 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : nice work!
[8/14/24, 4:56:41 PM] Chin Chin: agreed
[8/14/24, 4:56:53 PM] Chin Chin: I definitely think we are going to use this gradient a lot more often
[8/14/24, 4:57:01 PM] Iris Dey: Lmao
[8/14/24, 4:57:13 PM] Iris Dey: After the QR code is done I'll send the PDF
[8/14/24, 4:57:26 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: ok wait smth feels off for me
[8/14/24, 4:57:31 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: i think it’s that half is left aligned
[8/14/24, 4:57:33 PM] Iris Dey: Okok
[8/14/24, 4:57:34 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: half is middle aligned
[8/14/24, 4:57:51 PM] Iris Dey: Wait yeah let me try fixing it
[8/14/24, 4:58:18 PM] Iris Dey: Also we should make a folder so like next boards can use the same template and stuff
[8/14/24, 5:02:18 PM] Cleo Balaranjith: The text just looks squished
[8/14/24, 5:02:27 PM] Iris Dey: Yeah
[8/14/24, 5:02:33 PM] Chin Chin: yeah that would be a good idea
[8/14/24, 5:02:36 PM] Iris Dey: Imma make the middle text a lil smaller
[8/14/24, 5:02:42 PM] Cleo Balaranjith: Maybe a dif font
[8/14/24, 5:02:53 PM] Iris Dey: I can't find any good ones 😭
[8/14/24, 5:03:06 PM] Sanjana: I think you can say “sign up for events at the end of September” and we can just say the rest
[8/14/24, 5:03:14 PM] Iris Dey: Kk
[8/14/24, 5:03:32 PM] Sanjana: by the way totally agree this is great iris

[8/14/24, 5:08:11 PM] Chin Chin: i still think what pranav said about the text alignment could be fixed

[8/14/24, 5:09:12 PM] Iris Dey: file
[8/14/24, 5:09:21 PM] Sanjana: iris, I think if u remove the - and make it center justified?
[8/14/24, 5:09:24 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: ok wait we should use this gradient as our pptx bg
[8/14/24, 5:09:25 PM] Sanjana: for the upper text
[8/14/24, 5:09:38 PM] Iris Dey: oh

[8/15/24, 7:58:38 AM] Iris Dey: yeah
[8/15/24, 7:58:58 AM] Sanjana: no board game design is surprising though?
[8/15/24, 7:59:12 AM] Iris Dey: it might be because they never had a theme?
[8/15/24, 7:59:14 AM] Shruthika Balasubramania : Wait actually idk if every theme is released
[8/15/24, 7:59:19 AM] Iris Dey: it was just too make a board game design

[8/28/24, 3:17:58 PM] Iris Dey: Yeah in the interest meeting
[8/28/24, 3:17:59 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: i want to guarantee events for all event winners but idk if that's gonna work
[8/28/24, 3:18:06 PM] Iris Dey: Cuz everyone gonna expect to get there events
[8/28/24, 3:18:10 PM] Cleo Balaranjith: Yeah
[8/28/24, 3:18:18 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: no like within ourselves as well
[8/28/24, 3:18:23 PM] Cleo Balaranjith: lets put a max of 2 for freshmen
[8/28/24, 3:18:23 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: how do we want to give out events

[8/28/24, 3:19:54 PM] Iris Dey: Some events are easier then others
[8/28/24, 3:19:55 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: interest meeting we should talk more abt what the club is, changes that may be happening, etc. eetc.
[8/28/24, 3:20:09 PM] Iris Dey: image omitted

[8/28/24, 3:23:09 PM] Cleo Balaranjith: to state
[8/28/24, 3:23:09 PM] Sanjana: i think we should talk abt low enrollment events bc those typically don’t get a lot of signups
[8/28/24, 3:23:22 PM] Iris Dey: We should hyped those ones up
[8/28/24, 3:23:35 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: makes sense yeah
[8/28/24, 3:23:45 PM] Sanjana: + also did i alr tell you guys about how eastlake prez wants to do regionals with us?
[8/28/24, 3:23:54 PM] Iris Dey: Yes
[8/28/24, 3:24:19 PM] Sanjana: i think we should discourage that honestly, if they’re gonna be assigned events they should actually do them
[8/28/24, 3:24:26 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: yeah
[8/28/24, 3:24:32 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: it’s on the ideaboard

[8/28/24, 3:29:13 PM] Chin Chin: imagine sharing pants with the one guy known for not wearing pants
[8/28/24, 3:29:19 PM] Sanjana: VIVAAN????
[8/28/24, 3:29:23 PM] Sanjana: no shot
[8/28/24, 3:29:28 PM] Iris Dey: 💀

[8/28/24, 3:30:04 PM] Iris Dey: Oh
[8/28/24, 3:31:15 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: yessir
[8/28/24, 4:09:33 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : Who?
[8/28/24, 4:09:45 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : Oh that’s cool
[8/28/24, 4:10:14 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : YESSS SAME
[8/28/24, 4:10:57 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : Top 10? Is that not hard to check
[8/28/24, 4:11:05 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : Oh nvm there’s a pdf
[8/28/24, 4:11:08 PM] Sanjana: not hard!
[8/28/24, 4:12:34 PM] Chin Chin: i feel like we should do top 5 state
[8/28/24, 4:12:37 PM] Chin Chin: and then top 10 nats
[8/28/24, 4:12:56 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : LMFAO
[8/28/24, 4:13:07 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : Yeah that’s what I was thinking
[8/28/24, 4:14:05 PM] Sanjana: I like that too
[8/28/24, 4:14:50 PM] Chin Chin: Given the fact that even though we have so many events, many events go pretty much untouched at our school
[8/28/24, 4:15:03 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : Yeah
[8/28/24, 4:15:18 PM] Chin Chin: So a larger chapter is probably going to limit most people down to like 1 event
[8/28/24, 4:16:13 PM] Sanjana: we should talk more abt this, we can say that this means you’ll have less competition 💀
[8/28/24, 4:16:13 PM] Chin Chin: Tbh, it's too early to say rn. A lot of the people who filled out the interest form mentioned that they are considering hosa, scioly, usabo, or think they won't have enough time, but definitely want to learn more
[8/28/24, 4:16:48 PM] Chin Chin: that only works so much, considering people don't think winning in those events really helps their high school portfolios
[8/28/24, 4:17:11 PM] Chin Chin: Christensen gave me a talking to today, saying that I shouldn't pursue CS at UW like everyone else
[8/28/24, 4:17:27 PM] Sanjana: please 😭
[8/28/24, 4:17:48 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : What??
[8/28/24, 4:17:51 PM] Sanjana: like ppl who aren’t interested in animatronics don’t want to do it bc it doesn’t fit with their other activities?
[8/28/24, 4:18:14 PM] Chin Chin: animatronics is a special case of Arduino trauma after freshman year
[8/28/24, 4:18:38 PM] Chin Chin: he was like, "you won't be living up to your full potential by conforming to everyone"
[8/28/24, 4:18:44 PM] Sanjana: christensen likes to be quirky
[8/28/24, 4:18:46 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : 💀💀
[8/28/24, 4:18:50 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : Is he okay
[8/28/24, 4:18:59 PM] Chin Chin: lmao i think he's the only sane one right now
[8/28/24, 4:19:17 PM] Chin Chin: people are applying to over 200 different internships in their free time just to get one in CS
[8/28/24, 4:19:25 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : WHAT
[8/28/24, 4:19:29 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : is that an exaggeration
[8/28/24, 4:19:43 PM] Sanjana: I don’t even doubt this 😭
[8/28/24, 4:19:48 PM] Chin Chin: my sister, Mohit (class of 2023), and every cousin I know
[8/28/24, 4:20:07 PM] Chin Chin: CS is fully cooked
[8/28/24, 4:20:21 PM] Sanjana: laughs in engineering
[8/28/24, 4:20:30 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : Wait ur doing engineering ??
[8/28/24, 4:20:31 PM] Chin Chin: mkay engineering
[8/28/24, 4:20:36 PM] Chin Chin: CS kids are taking that stuff too
[8/28/24, 4:20:37 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : I thought biochem
[8/28/24, 4:20:50 PM] Sanjana: biomed engineering!
[8/28/24, 4:20:54 PM] Sanjana: close enough 😇 <This message was edited>
[8/28/24, 4:21:03 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : Oh that’s cool

[8/28/24, 5:57:43 PM] Iris Dey: But female bias 😍
[8/28/24, 6:03:49 PM] Sanjana: oof i didn’t expect you to say something like that

[8/28/24, 6:04:11 PM] Chin Chin: mean
[8/28/24, 6:08:02 PM] Iris Dey: It's true tho
[8/28/24, 6:08:11 PM] Iris Dey: Like they didn't decide to go into cs
[8/28/24, 6:08:16 PM] Iris Dey: Until like middle of highschool

[9/6/24, 5:14:10 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : TSA 9/6/24 meeting notes 
Schedule:
- $20 payment, then events- that’s when mandatory attendance happens
- event allocation by mid october
- oct 17th or 18th chapter officer workshop

Meetings:

- weekly meetings
- supposed to keep attendance- someone stands at the door taking attendance, meeting notes
- when registering for events, ms. kankelborg chooses the team captain
- make it clear that jan 11 deadline is important and even non team captains can check for submission
- meeting next week, 2 weeks for fees, 2 weeks for event registration
- goals:
    - priority for events: verify qualifications- juniors get highest priority, then sophomores, then seniors, then freshman
    - forensics: junior only event
    - spread out state and national qualifiers
    - past competitors give 30 sec blurb about event and what it was like
    - make sure library follows tsa rules
    - prioritize telling them to read rubric, workshops and walking through events
    - every meeting cover 3 events
    - be more hands on with the team: have interviews,
    - talk to ms zebrack about using her room for b lunch, mr boyd could be an advisor but doesn’t have a room
    - elect freshman rep in the first month
    - come in early leave late so airport is less packed, chaperone at hotel
    - parent chaperones don’t get paid for, and might not be as inclined to follow rules
    - event guide reading workshop, be quizzed on it, size restrictions,
    - more social media presence, eastlake comp is on backburner, jan 23, presentation review, merch, maybe printing merch on ms. k’s device
    - pranav sends shruthika the club budget form, use it for buses, etc.
    
    Now:
    
    - meet over weekend and create protocol which we can present in the next meeting
- Ms. Kankelborg’s advice:
    - website: get reports in the way you put things into the tsa website by student by team, not kicking people off boards and teams without advisor, NO VEX, general board communication: make sure everyone’s in the private channel
[9/6/24, 5:14:26 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : here r the meeting notes i just split by category
[9/6/24, 5:15:36 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: thx shruthika
[9/6/24, 5:16:20 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: if u have a sec could you put it in the shared folder
[9/6/24, 5:16:29 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: in a new doc

[9/6/24, 6:28:07 PM] Iris Dey: Pranav let us know when u start working on the ppt
[9/6/24, 6:31:31 PM] Chin Chin: Mayank is begging to keep vex
[9/6/24, 6:31:37 PM] Chin Chin: even if it's state only
[9/6/24, 6:32:21 PM] Iris Dey: Lol I told him that it's not gonna happen bruh
[9/6/24, 6:32:23 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : why? I'm not sure Ms. Kankelborg will be fine with that
[9/6/24, 6:32:27 PM] Iris Dey: It's not even that deep
[9/6/24, 6:32:33 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : Does he not have another competition
[9/6/24, 6:32:36 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : for robotics
[9/6/24, 6:32:45 PM] Iris Dey: Exat
[9/6/24, 6:32:47 PM] Iris Dey: Exactly
[9/6/24, 6:32:50 PM] Chin Chin: he does
[9/6/24, 6:32:52 PM] Cleo Balaranjith: There's like so many bro I used to do vex
[9/6/24, 6:32:59 PM] Cleo Balaranjith: like unofficial ones too
[9/6/24, 6:33:01 PM] Chin Chin: but idk I feel like there's 15 kids from our school who do vex
[9/6/24, 6:33:07 PM] Chin Chin: which 15 kids not troubling other evenrs
[9/6/24, 6:33:14 PM] Chin Chin: and the only thing she needs to do is show up early
[9/6/24, 6:33:20 PM] Chin Chin: which is kind of her job
[9/6/24, 6:33:47 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : I think the problem is she would have to go another day
[9/6/24, 6:33:55 PM] Iris Dey: Yeah
[9/6/24, 6:34:00 PM] Chin Chin: yeah I get that
[9/6/24, 6:34:02 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : as in if she went a day early someone would have to take care of us
[9/6/24, 6:34:02 PM] Iris Dey: And Spokane is 6 hours away
[9/6/24, 6:34:07 PM] Chin Chin: 4
[9/6/24, 6:34:10 PM] Iris Dey: Vex TSA is not even that important
[9/6/24, 6:34:10 PM] Cleo Balaranjith: Oh yeah
[9/6/24, 6:34:14 PM] Iris Dey: Same thing
[9/6/24, 6:34:17 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : so its a bit stressful on her, but if they really want it, maybe
[9/6/24, 6:34:32 PM] Chin Chin: I understand that
[9/6/24, 6:34:32 PM] Iris Dey: Kank knows better
[9/6/24, 6:34:39 PM] Cleo Balaranjith: Its not really necessary if its this much trouble
[9/6/24, 6:34:44 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : Idk what would happen with the chaperone thing though
[9/6/24, 6:34:49 PM] Chin Chin: but if Washington TSA is offering the event, I don't see how we have the right to not do the same
[9/6/24, 6:34:53 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : That's the main problem I feel
[9/6/24, 6:35:04 PM] Chin Chin: as people paying for TSA
[9/6/24, 6:35:14 PM] Chin Chin: they have the right to compete on whatever event they choose and can get
[9/6/24, 6:35:22 PM] Cleo Balaranjith: TSA vex is probably easier then normal vex competitions and less organized
[9/6/24, 6:35:25 PM] Chin Chin: regardless of whether the event doesnt matter
[9/6/24, 6:35:26 PM] Iris Dey: Ask kank about it
[9/6/24, 6:35:27 PM] Cleo Balaranjith: that's why people want ir
[9/6/24, 6:35:35 PM] Chin Chin: yeah I will
[9/6/24, 6:35:40 PM] Iris Dey: She's probably gonna say no tho
[9/6/24, 6:35:45 PM] Chin Chin: yeah
[9/6/24, 6:35:46 PM] Cleo Balaranjith: but its not worth just going for vex
[9/6/24, 6:35:52 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : All we need to do is tell ms kankelborg people are still interested
[9/6/24, 6:35:54 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : its up to her
[9/6/24, 6:36:01 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : not for us to decide i think
[9/6/24, 6:36:02 PM] Iris Dey: Well she probably knows that
[9/6/24, 6:36:06 PM] Chin Chin: honestly dude, if chaperones is the issue, vex kids parents can go
[9/6/24, 6:36:15 PM] Chin Chin: cuz that's how vex kids are
[9/6/24, 6:36:16 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : Oh maybe
[9/6/24, 6:36:26 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : yeah
[9/6/24, 6:36:35 PM] Chin Chin: I wanna make sure I exhaust all options of making it happen before saying no
[9/6/24, 6:36:39 PM] Chin Chin: simply cuz it's a win win
[9/6/24, 6:36:42 PM] Cleo Balaranjith: But why would u go all the way there just for vex
[9/6/24, 6:36:49 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : You're right that makes sense
[9/6/24, 6:36:56 PM] Chin Chin: people drive for 6-7.hkurs for vex comps
[9/6/24, 6:36:58 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : because its a competition
[9/6/24, 6:37:10 PM] Cleo Balaranjith: yeah but its unofficial
[9/6/24, 6:37:13 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : and they have the robot built alr probably
[9/6/24, 6:37:20 PM] Iris Dey: But that qualifies for smth
[9/6/24, 6:37:23 PM] Cleo Balaranjith: Oh yeah that's true
[9/6/24, 6:37:24 PM] Iris Dey: This doesnt
[9/6/24, 6:37:34 PM] Cleo Balaranjith: is Sid nikkam doing TSA this yr
[9/6/24, 6:37:38 PM] Iris Dey: 💀
[9/6/24, 6:37:38 PM] Chin Chin: most likely not
[9/6/24, 6:37:39 PM] Sanjana: Likely
[9/6/24, 6:37:40 PM] Iris Dey: Probably
[9/6/24, 6:37:49 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : its just a state event I understand why people want it and even if its not a nats event its still competitive
[9/6/24, 6:37:57 PM] Chin Chin: yeah exactly
[9/6/24, 6:38:15 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : kk so ill add that to the meeting notes
[9/6/24, 6:38:20 PM] Chin Chin: thanks
[9/6/24, 6:38:27 PM] Iris Dey: I bet that if mayank does another event then vex
[9/6/24, 6:38:27 PM] Chin Chin: don't worry I'll bring it up
[9/6/24, 6:38:28 PM] Iris Dey: She might
[9/6/24, 6:38:35 PM] Chin Chin: yeah
[9/6/24, 6:38:38 PM] Chin Chin: we'll see
[9/6/24, 6:38:45 PM] Iris Dey: But it's and hassle for her also
[9/6/24, 6:38:51 PM] Iris Dey: So it's understandable if she says no
[9/6/24, 6:39:09 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: i think it’s weird registration and logistic stuff as well for her
[9/6/24, 6:39:37 PM] Chin Chin: if she says no because of traveling, I think we can solve it
[9/6/24, 6:39:42 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : Yeah we'll see
[9/6/24, 6:39:54 PM] Iris Dey: I also think she despises the vex kids 😭
[9/6/24, 6:40:02 PM] Chin Chin: well that's her problem
[9/6/24, 6:40:08 PM] Iris Dey: Yeah I guess
[9/6/24, 6:40:27 PM] Iris Dey: Idk why they wanna do it that bad tho
[9/6/24, 6:40:35 PM] Iris Dey: It's probably cuz exmaxhina also going
[9/6/24, 6:40:50 PM] Chin Chin: they're not wrong to want to stick to their strengths
[9/6/24, 6:40:57 PM] Cleo Balaranjith: She did first robotics so...
[9/6/24, 6:40:58 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : yeah
[9/6/24, 6:40:59 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : its fine
[9/6/24, 6:41:00 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : its their choice
[9/6/24, 6:41:06 PM] Chin Chin: plus the awards are always a good motivation
[9/6/24, 6:41:17 PM] Iris Dey: I guess
[9/6/24, 6:41:25 PM] Chin Chin: and our teams are pretty good too
[9/6/24, 6:41:28 PM] Chin Chin: more awards for us
[9/6/24, 6:41:47 PM] Iris Dey: They were being a lil silly during nats
[9/6/24, 6:41:58 PM] Chin Chin: so were we
[9/6/24, 6:42:07 PM] Chin Chin: as in me
[9/6/24, 6:42:11 PM] Chin Chin: and Mr pants
[9/6/24, 6:42:15 PM] Iris Dey: 😭😭😭
[9/6/24, 6:42:37 PM] Iris Dey: If parents drive them then it shouldn't be a problem
[9/6/24, 6:42:45 PM] Chin Chin: yeah
[9/6/24, 6:42:47 PM] Iris Dey: But it's also kanks responsibility for them to get on time
[9/6/24, 6:42:53 PM] Iris Dey: So it kinda is her problem
[9/6/24, 6:42:59 PM] Chin Chin: we'll see

[9/11/24, 5:15:19 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : Idk it works now dw
[9/11/24, 5:22:09 PM] Chin Chin: Important notes about my discussion with Kankelborg regarding registration rules:
- She was wondering about how we may promote equity from a gender perspective through registration process. I mentioned how, if teams are equal at a surface level, we would be conducting interviews, which could help us select the most qualified candidates, regardless of gender. She thought that should be good enough, but we both agreed that we should get ideas from the whole board on this topic.
- She said that we don't have to be completely transparent about registration criteria. For example, with the grade-based selection algorithm, instead of specifying exactly how it is calculated, we can mention that it is a weighted average, or just "some fancy algorithm stuff" What do you guys think?
- She also said that we should consider involving teachers that are related to the events students are applying to not only get a better perspective on how is most qualified, and ask about their perspectives on the work ethic of the students applying for those events if they were in their classes. She also said that perhaps we can ask students, in situations of clashes, to have a teacher submit a referral form (keep it very short, not like a letter of rec) vouching for their qualifications.
[9/11/24, 5:23:12 PM] Chin Chin: all these notes are also added at the bottom of the registration document in our team's shared folder under the Board Documents Folder
[9/11/24, 5:39:14 PM] Iris Dey: 1) I feel like gender equality would be hard in the sense that, would it be fair for people to choose over gender or qualifications like engineering design if most of the teams were weighted female that did good wouldn't it be better to give it to them, then by gender also it would be considered not equal if we chose against gender created a sexist environment and ppl adding the other gender to fit the quota
2)yeah we don't really need to say allat except like forensics 
3)I definitely think we can because all of us know the majority of the teachers
[9/11/24, 5:41:54 PM] Cleo Balaranjith: When u mean get teachers involved u mean in the like interview or choosing  process
[9/11/24, 5:41:57 PM] Cleo Balaranjith: right?
[9/11/24, 5:42:01 PM] Iris Dey: yeah
[9/11/24, 5:42:02 PM] Chin Chin: yeah
[9/11/24, 5:42:32 PM] Cleo Balaranjith: that's going to be annoying because many teachers aren't that familiar with TSA
[9/11/24, 5:42:39 PM] Cleo Balaranjith: or how TSA does things
[9/11/24, 5:42:41 PM] Iris Dey: i think its just overall
[9/11/24, 5:42:43 PM] Iris Dey: in projects
[9/11/24, 5:42:48 PM] Chin Chin: yeah it will have to be voluntary
[9/11/24, 5:43:19 PM] Cleo Balaranjith: how bout we get like graduates who have done that event in the past and js simply ask them for that process
[9/11/24, 5:43:29 PM] Cleo Balaranjith: like even tesla stem ones
[9/11/24, 5:43:35 PM] Chin Chin: possibly
[9/11/24, 5:43:35 PM] Cleo Balaranjith: we have that data right
[9/11/24, 5:43:41 PM] Chin Chin: yeag
[9/11/24, 5:43:45 PM] Chin Chin: issue is getting in touch
[9/11/24, 5:43:53 PM] Cleo Balaranjith: yeah
[9/11/24, 5:43:57 PM] Chin Chin: but that shouldn't be too bad
[9/11/24, 5:44:22 PM] Chin Chin: also, we have to understand that some events have become drastically more competitive than they were the years before
[9/11/24, 5:44:34 PM] Cleo Balaranjith: Their prolly more knowledgeable abt that exact event than any teacher we can find
[9/11/24, 5:44:39 PM] Cleo Balaranjith: yeah
[9/11/24, 5:45:03 PM] Iris Dey: but were asking teachers how well the student is in school projects we cant ask graduates about students
[9/11/24, 5:45:25 PM] Sanjana: I think instead of a letter of rec form we ask the teacher very specific questions
[9/11/24, 5:45:31 PM] Cleo Balaranjith: School projects aren't like TSA events
[9/11/24, 5:45:32 PM] Iris Dey: yes
[9/11/24, 5:45:38 PM] Sanjana: bc otherwise they’re just glazing the students and we don’t need that
[9/11/24, 5:45:44 PM] Iris Dey: but its in a group setting
[9/11/24, 5:45:48 PM] Iris Dey: its just overall how they do
[9/11/24, 5:45:48 PM] Cleo Balaranjith: ig
[9/11/24, 5:45:53 PM] Sanjana: actually wait
[9/11/24, 5:46:05 PM] Sanjana: there’s going to be at least 30 interviews
[9/11/24, 5:46:08 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : 1) Diversity is very important but it doesn’t make sense to me to force it, especially for TSA. A lot of people would be angry rather than girls being empowered if gender had a say and it would make more sense if we just spread awareness about it in the way we speak rather than straight up leaning towards giving an event to girls. Also, I agree with iris that it might be too complicated to add in this factor when we have others like states and nats quals
[9/11/24, 5:46:11 PM] Sanjana: we don’t even have that many teachers
[9/11/24, 5:46:30 PM] Iris Dey: yeah bro
[9/11/24, 5:46:35 PM] Sanjana: like eight ppl are gonna ask one teacher and that’s just adding work for them
[9/11/24, 5:46:41 PM] Iris Dey: we probably have to ask teh same teacher about 10 of them
[9/11/24, 5:46:43 PM] Iris Dey: yeah
[9/11/24, 5:46:48 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : 2) I agree because I feel like being very transparent would incite a lot of arguments so it’s best to say it’s with an algorithm
[9/11/24, 5:47:14 PM] Sanjana: I’m not too keen on involving teachers, at most we say “do you have concerns about the student’s ability to see projects through to the end/be disciplined?”
[9/11/24, 5:48:00 PM] Iris Dey: lowkey i mean atleast one of us probably has been in a group with whoever were gonna interview <This message was edited>
[9/11/24, 5:48:04 PM] Iris Dey: we have a small ass school
[9/11/24, 5:48:06 PM] Iris Dey: 😭
[9/11/24, 5:48:14 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : 3) I think we don’t need a letter, just a quick Microsoft form that asks about attendance, how they work in projects, and their character/ any other concerns
[9/11/24, 5:48:20 PM] Sanjana: LMFAOOOOO SO TRUE
[9/11/24, 5:48:20 PM] Iris Dey: except freshman
[9/11/24, 5:48:40 PM] Sanjana: yeah and it can be very quick questions I don’t want to make them do a long response
[9/11/24, 5:48:49 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : YES
[9/11/24, 5:49:05 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : Yeah
[9/11/24, 5:49:09 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : Like 5 min max
[9/11/24, 5:49:15 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : The form shouldn’t take any longer
[9/11/24, 5:49:23 PM] Sanjana: yup yup
[9/11/24, 5:49:46 PM] Sanjana: I think we should specifically ask about concerns rather than “how does this student do in class”
[9/11/24, 5:50:10 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : Yeah
[9/11/24, 5:50:20 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : But also how they work in group projects
[9/11/24, 5:50:55 PM] Iris Dey: interviews are gonna be so silly
[9/11/24, 5:51:20 PM] Sanjana: yes agreed
[9/11/24, 5:51:40 PM] Sanjana: just to clarify we’re only using interviews if there’s a clash right
[9/11/24, 5:51:48 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : What do you guys think?
[9/11/24, 5:52:03 PM] Iris Dey: Is there's too many ppl with the near point avg
[9/11/24, 5:52:30 PM] Iris Dey: I think it should be mentioned but not considered in event choosing
[9/11/24, 5:52:35 PM] Iris Dey: As u said
[9/11/24, 5:52:39 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : Like maybe we can have a conversation /ppt on empowering women in stem in a way that’s not directly in giving events
[9/11/24, 5:52:45 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : Sounds good
[9/11/24, 5:53:34 PM] Sanjana: oops sorry shruthika
[9/11/24, 5:54:03 PM] Chin Chin: that sounds like a good idea
[9/11/24, 5:54:13 PM] Chin Chin: I would want the ladies to take the lead on that tho
[9/11/24, 5:54:18 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : Yeah lol
[9/11/24, 5:54:53 PM] Sanjana: ^^ i like this, we can talk about it in the first couple meetings maybe
[9/11/24, 5:54:59 PM] Sanjana: whaat no way
[9/11/24, 5:55:01 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : And on the events sign up form, we can make a note saying we’d love to have more girls sign up for events
[9/11/24, 5:55:13 PM] Iris Dey: 😱
[9/11/24, 5:55:40 PM] Iris Dey: That can work
[9/11/24, 5:56:05 PM] Sanjana: I feel like yes, but. because the girls are reading that message, they’re already planning to sign up for events
[9/11/24, 5:56:31 PM] Sanjana: i feel like we’re toeing a very thin line of “let’s get more girls in” and “oh god we’ve heard this from Dr. wrenchey so many times it doesn’t have meaning anymore”
[9/11/24, 5:57:35 PM] Iris Dey: Yeah
[9/11/24, 5:58:01 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : Yeah, it’s good to state it though
[9/11/24, 5:58:40 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : We can worry about it later though towards event signup
[9/11/24, 6:03:37 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: what did i miss
[9/11/24, 6:03:57 PM] Iris Dey: We went over this in call with achintya
[9/11/24, 6:03:58 PM] Iris Dey: Already
[9/11/24, 6:04:04 PM] Iris Dey: I don't think u missed much
[9/11/24, 6:07:40 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: oh ok
[9/11/24, 6:07:46 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: what’s the final decision
[9/11/24, 6:18:07 PM] Chin Chin: no explicit action on diversity stuff via registration
[9/11/24, 6:18:22 PM] Chin Chin: semi transparency about how registration works
[9/11/24, 6:18:44 PM] Chin Chin: involve teachers, but making sure you're not killing their time
[9/11/24, 6:20:57 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : 👍
[9/11/24, 6:21:18 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: mhm
[9/11/24, 6:21:27 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: thx chin chin
[9/11/24, 8:58:47 PM] Karma Ibrahim: sorry guess I was at practice
[9/11/24, 9:00:00 PM] Karma Ibrahim: but I agree with the whole diversity thing for genders. We can just have a brief PPT empowering women in stem but it’s not fair to just take projects from all female. Also, we can take in teacher input through a forms or something only if there’s a clash between more than 1 team that wants to do the same event. That way teachers don’t get overwhelmed
[9/11/24, 9:00:27 PM] Chin Chin: looks like everyone is on the same page
[9/11/24, 9:00:29 PM] Chin Chin: great!
[9/11/24, 9:03:35 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: this is the most un achintya message i have ever seen

[9/12/24, 10:45:14 AM] Karma Ibrahim: I was thinking sanjana introduce everyone and yourself and then I can do what tsa is/evebts. Shruthika can do entry limits and timeline. Achintya opportunities and changes. And Pranav end it with freshman rep and next steps.
[9/12/24, 10:45:20 AM] Karma Ibrahim: Is that a good order?
[9/12/24, 12:03:40 PM] Iris Dey: No vex according to kank
[9/12/24, 12:03:42 PM] Iris Dey: And she added us to officer lounge
[9/12/24, 12:04:00 PM] Iris Dey: She also discussed us about doing the chapter team event
[9/12/24, 12:05:35 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : Oh okay
[9/12/24, 12:05:39 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : Yeah I saw that
[9/12/24, 12:05:54 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : Why specifically us? Is it not open to all members?
[9/12/24, 1:55:55 PM] Karma Ibrahim: it is it’s just that we’ll probably know more
[9/12/24, 3:15:42 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : Yeah, I think we should wait and see based on how event registration goes
[9/12/24, 3:16:04 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : Because I don’t want to unnecessarily take up a possible backup event for people
[9/12/24, 3:16:08 PM] Chin Chin: aryaman and bhanu were cribbing about the top 3 thing
[9/12/24, 3:16:23 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : Yeah but it makes sense ngl
[9/12/24, 3:16:31 PM] Chin Chin: i kinda see their point
[9/12/24, 3:16:41 PM] Chin Chin: but I still think that this is the the right direction to go in
[9/12/24, 3:18:17 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : Since a goal is also doing well at nats, Im not too convinced with the new rule
[9/12/24, 3:18:26 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : What’s your opinion on an in house competition?
[9/12/24, 3:22:22 PM] Chin Chin: here's my opinion on the issue
[9/12/24, 3:22:39 PM] Chin Chin: right now, the only people who would get the events due to prior qualifications are seniors
[9/12/24, 3:22:44 PM] Chin Chin: atleast top 3
[9/12/24, 3:23:04 PM] Chin Chin: so if there's one spot for webmaster, we get it instead of the three teams of juniors that could
[9/12/24, 3:26:38 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : I’ll respond when I get home
[9/12/24, 3:26:58 PM] Chin Chin: yeah I'm at the gym too lol
[9/12/24, 3:27:06 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : lol nice

[9/12/24, 3:30:47 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: bc i think we need to find a medium
[9/12/24, 3:30:55 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: cause i agree with both sides here
[9/12/24, 3:31:03 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: like yes Nats winners don’t need the events
[9/12/24, 3:31:09 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: but also yes we want STEM to win
[9/12/24, 3:31:20 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: and i think what we have rn does neither
[9/12/24, 3:31:21 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : Yes that’s what I think too
[9/12/24, 3:31:22 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: we take away awards
[9/12/24, 3:31:29 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: and we don’t open a lot of slots
[9/12/24, 3:31:34 PM] Iris Dey: should i ping stem tsa i posted the meeting ppt
[9/12/24, 3:31:38 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: like three slots get opened bc of this
[9/12/24, 3:31:40 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: yes pls do
[9/12/24, 3:31:49 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: so we need to find smth in the middle
[9/12/24, 3:33:11 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: and yk i’ll be kinda sore abt it
[9/12/24, 3:33:17 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: but i don’t mind giving up those events

[9/12/24, 3:37:50 PM] Iris Dey: cuz achintya was talking about chanign it
[9/12/24, 3:37:58 PM] Iris Dey: no top 3 nats
[9/12/24, 3:38:02 PM] Iris Dey: can re get there event
[9/12/24, 3:39:01 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : ohh ok
[9/12/24, 3:39:55 PM] Chin Chin: we should still talk about it some more
[9/12/24, 3:40:16 PM] Chin Chin: I only told her our side of things, but not the other logic
[9/12/24, 3:43:59 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : Wait I’m confused
[9/12/24, 3:44:13 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : So Ms kankelborg does NOT want top 3 nats competing again
[9/12/24, 3:44:15 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : Right?
[9/12/24, 3:48:58 PM] Iris Dey: yes
[9/12/24, 3:55:31 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : kk
[9/12/24, 4:19:13 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : Here's how I feel about the new no top 3 nats rule:
I think it's really important to give others an opportunity to do events, but I also feel like the new rule is bad for STEM winning awards because that is definitely important as well. Also, we had a completely different rule until this year, so to change it all at once might not be a good idea.
I think in order to have a middle ground we have some possibilities:
1) For events that allow 2 or more teams, we could allow 1 team with qualifications and allow the rest to be other people. This is a balance between giving opportunity but at the same time keeping the people dedicated to winning awards
2) We have an inhouse competition which has equal opportunity for everyone so the people who go to state are dedicated and have a chance at nats
[9/12/24, 4:20:25 PM] Chin Chin: I really wanna push back against in house competitions because a) they're a lot of work for us and b) it means students are going to waste time. building a submission for an event that they don't get to participate in
[9/12/24, 4:21:20 PM] Chin Chin: and for option 1, we had multiple engineering design teams make it to nats last year. which one would we choose if we could only choose one?
[9/12/24, 4:21:46 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : the one who placed higher imo
[9/12/24, 4:22:06 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : but thats a good point let me think
[9/12/24, 4:38:45 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : a) I feel like we could figure something out, because it only applies to like 2 events and b) I feel like the regionals qualifier does the same thing especially because its much harsher this year
[9/12/24, 4:39:29 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : for this, I don't think that's much of an issue, I feel like it should still be the ones who placed higher because at least the other ones have experience doing the event, but if it comes down to that I don't mind either
[9/12/24, 5:29:14 PM] Cleo Balaranjith: Yeah we don't want those but we shud prioritize people who have done TSA over people who are new join this year
[9/12/24, 5:30:25 PM] Cleo Balaranjith: we wanna make sure that people who have put in effort into TSA already get the event they want and not get it stolen by anyone new no matter what grade they are
[9/12/24, 5:30:38 PM] Cleo Balaranjith: this is cuz we have a lot of new people this year
[9/12/24, 5:31:57 PM] Iris Dey: the top 3 nats rule only effects like 2 teams right
[9/12/24, 5:32:40 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: yeah
[9/12/24, 5:32:43 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: webmaster

[10/1/24, 9:58:34 PM] Iris Dey: i mean the parents pay at the end of the day ig
[10/1/24, 9:58:42 PM] Sanjana: based off what Alex said it wasn’t really that he forgot, more that the circumstances of his home didn’t allow that
[10/1/24, 9:58:45 PM] Cleo Balaranjith: But still
[10/1/24, 9:58:55 PM] Sanjana: this is a valid concern though to be honest
[10/1/24, 9:59:00 PM] Iris Dey: yeah i understand with his case though
[10/1/24, 9:59:13 PM] Iris Dey: ive had time where my parents were too busy to pay for things
[10/1/24, 9:59:19 PM] Iris Dey: i think we should just let it slide
[10/1/24, 9:59:20 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: and idk
[10/1/24, 9:59:25 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: in his case it's 20 dollars
[10/1/24, 9:59:26 PM] Sanjana: me too
[10/1/24, 9:59:28 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: its important to his apps
[10/1/24, 9:59:35 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: and his parents didn't pay
[10/1/24, 9:59:36 PM] Chin Chin: fine
[10/1/24, 9:59:40 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: for a valid reason
[10/1/24, 9:59:43 PM] Iris Dey: if he slips up paying the next round
[10/1/24, 9:59:49 PM] Iris Dey: then thats on him tho
[10/1/24, 9:59:51 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: then he wasted 20 dollars
[10/1/24, 9:59:58 PM] Sanjana: yeah I agree
[10/1/24, 9:59:59 PM] Chin Chin: I just feel like he's gonna tell everyone to "tell you parents to email them and they let you in"
[10/1/24, 10:00:10 PM] Iris Dey: ill tell him not too
[10/1/24, 10:00:12 PM] Sanjana: we can tell him if he tells ppl, he’s not getting a single event
[10/1/24, 10:00:15 PM] Cleo Balaranjith: Next round we have to make it strict
[10/1/24, 10:00:20 PM] Iris Dey: yeah
[10/1/24, 10:00:20 PM] Cleo Balaranjith: like really

[10/1/24, 10:00:30 PM] Cleo Balaranjith: no going past
[10/1/24, 10:00:44 PM] Chin Chin: and also that just makes it seem like more of a secret
[10/1/24, 10:01:17 PM] Iris Dey: just do a post saying event registration is closed were not accpeting anyone and send the list of ppl

[10/2/24, 5:03:16 AM] Shruthika Balasubramania : I want to, but won’t this just encourage other people to get their parents involved?
[10/2/24, 5:03:54 AM] Shruthika Balasubramania : I think it would be better if they could prove they couldn’t pay, just so they understand
[10/2/24, 5:03:56 AM] Shruthika Balasubramania : But idk
[10/2/24, 5:05:04 AM] Shruthika Balasubramania : Yeah

[10/4/24, 10:06:13 PM] Cleo Balaranjith: Its fine there's nothing to take at stem anyways
[10/4/24, 10:06:25 PM] Cleo Balaranjith: but 7 periods is always better
[10/4/24, 10:07:10 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : Yeah 6 periods at stem just means the lab classes will be combined into one period
[10/4/24, 10:07:13 PM] Sanjana: wait question the thing says less time for ECs
[10/4/24, 10:07:18 PM] Iris Dey: LMAOOO

[10/4/24, 10:08:22 PM] Cleo Balaranjith: maybe
[10/4/24, 10:08:22 PM] Iris Dey: Stem should be quirky and keep 7 periods
[10/4/24, 10:08:28 PM] Cleo Balaranjith: Yess
[10/4/24, 10:08:37 PM] Iris Dey: Like how our schedules are like already different
[10/5/24, 4:42:09 PM] Timothy An: would STEM have to abide by LWSD policies or if we have enough money, can we continue with 7 periods?
[10/5/24, 4:45:03 PM] Sanjana: It’s not really about the money— this was a decision that’s been years in the making
[10/5/24, 4:45:24 PM] Timothy An: ah i see. do we know exactly why theyre switching to 6 periods?
[10/5/24, 4:54:07 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : Yeah their intent was less stress for students

[10/14/24, 5:08:10 PM] Timothy An: also the hierarchy system is seniors, juniors, sophomores, then freshmen right. but among the grades themselves, its first come, first serve right?
[10/14/24, 5:08:21 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: what
[10/14/24, 5:08:43 PM] Timothy An: seniors get first priority right
[10/14/24, 5:08:48 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: how it works i s juniors get most priority
[10/14/24, 5:08:50 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: then sophomoroes

[10/14/24, 5:09:04 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: and there’s a whole algorithm that does this
[10/14/24, 5:09:22 PM] Timothy An: how abt within the grades themselves?
[10/14/24, 5:09:27 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: for example a senior that’s qualified to nationals but not won will get highest priority
[10/14/24, 5:09:37 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: it’s first by past experience
[10/14/24, 5:09:39 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: then by grade
[10/14/24, 5:09:42 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: and then by team size
[10/14/24, 5:09:56 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: and then an algorithm that helps us place everyone into an event

[10/18/24, 2:20:56 PM] Cleo Balaranjith: i sent him this email:
Mr Christensen,
You are right! I did use AI in writing my apology and I'm extremely sorry that I did. See I use AI to modify and correct any in-concise statements in emails, text messages, and in this case a letter. This is something that I do casually and it's second nature to me. Since this wasn't an assignment from school or whatever and it wouldn't be considered academic dishonest if I used an AI resource. As you can see in the screenshot below, I simply asked ChatGPT to "make this right". It took the genuine apology that I wrote myself (that had dozens of errors) and made it a lot easier to read and fixed grammatical errors. I am not saying that what I did was right. It's that when I modify my own words (especially in emails) I get a much more positive response. I thought the same for the apology letter for Mr. Carlin. 
It was my stupidity that I did not read the sign and intruded into his workspace. But now I understand that at an apology letter should be all me. 

I am deeply sorry Mr. Carlin and I should have taken the time to make my own words concise and rid of errors. 

Sincerely,
Cleo Balaranjith

[10/20/24, 10:23:21 PM] Timothy An: is it worth it to set up a channel where people can say what events theyre interested in and have others contact them?

[10/20/24, 10:34:15 PM] Chin Chin: while I'm at it, should I add a feature in the website to let people know how many teams have signed up for an event?
[10/20/24, 10:34:28 PM] Cleo Balaranjith: no bro uk Christensen he takes like a week to reply😭😞

[10/20/24, 10:36:01 PM] Chin Chin: my thing is, if people can see that there's a shitton of teams signing up for an event, and choose something else, we save ourselves quite a bit of hassle
[10/20/24, 10:36:06 PM] Chin Chin: they do the algorithmic stuff for us
[10/20/24, 10:36:13 PM] Timothy An: yeah i think thatd be helpful
[10/20/24, 10:36:17 PM] Chin Chin: we don't tell them what teams have signed up, just how many
[10/20/24, 10:36:34 PM] Chin Chin: or we could do like "high volume event", "medium volume event" and "low volume event
[10/20/24, 10:36:36 PM] Chin Chin: warnings
[10/20/24, 10:36:44 PM] Chin Chin: so they can use those to make a decision

[10/20/24, 10:38:32 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: 50% of total capacity
[10/20/24, 10:38:34 PM] Iris Dey: If there's 2 more then needed
[10/20/24, 10:38:37 PM] Iris Dey: If should be high

[10/22/24, 9:35:57 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : I know some people trying out so I can check with them if they want another team member
[10/22/24, 9:36:49 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : He can also trying soloing the events but the thing is there’s a lot of junior/senior teams that will get priority
[10/22/24, 9:37:06 PM] Timothy An: Idk what I'm supposed to tell him
[10/22/24, 9:37:27 PM] Timothy An: Id feel bad if we tell him that but can't guarantee a spot
[10/23/24, 6:40:17 AM] Shruthika Balasubramania : We can’t guarantee a spot either way though all those events have enough teams applying as far as I know who have more priority over a freshman
[10/23/24, 6:40:55 AM] Iris Dey: All the events he's applying for are also like very high priority I'm assuming
[10/23/24, 6:41:02 AM] Iris Dey: Except maybe video game design
[10/23/24, 6:44:30 AM] Shruthika Balasubramania : Dear Avik, I completely understand your situation, and I thank you for being proactive in using the TSA channel. I would recommend reaching out to people either in person or some other platform asking to form a team, and the board will try asking others as well.    The events you picked are great but also high demand so many people will apply to them. If there are less common events (systems technology, etc) that you think you might be interested in, you may have a higher chance of getting one of those. Worst case, on the last day you can sign up to do the event by yourself, it’s just that in that case you won’t be given priority.
[10/23/24, 10:47:54 AM] Timothy An: Thanks! Changed a couple words here and there but I'll let you all know if he says anything
[10/23/24, 5:53:42 PM] Iris Dey: Meeting tomorrow correct?

[10/23/24, 7:02:17 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : Yeah I’m not sure what we should talk about
[10/23/24, 7:07:35 PM] Chin Chin: I'm adding some stuff to allow kids to sort events by priority

[10/23/24, 10:00:38 PM] Cleo Balaranjith: i mean most people know
[10/23/24, 10:00:43 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : It’s good but didn’t you say lowest to highest priority?
[10/23/24, 10:00:49 PM] Cleo Balaranjith: and if they wanna they can email right?
[10/23/24, 10:00:51 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : This makes sense thou th
[10/23/24, 10:00:52 PM] Iris Dey: doesnt matter lmao
[10/23/24, 10:00:53 PM] Chin Chin: well yeah but idt it matters
[10/23/24, 10:01:08 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : Yeah
[10/23/24, 10:01:27 PM] Chin Chin: ok wait I'm going to make it so that only the current team captain can make someone else captain
[10/23/24, 10:01:29 PM] Chin Chin: otherwise it's weird
[10/23/24, 10:01:44 PM] Iris Dey: kk
[10/23/24, 10:01:45 PM] Chin Chin: is that okay?
[10/23/24, 10:01:48 PM] Iris Dey: yeah
[10/23/24, 10:01:50 PM] Iris Dey: makes sense
[10/23/24, 10:01:59 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : Also if they have high priority for an event of 1st choice like a nats quality, they can prioritize the event they’re less likely to get even if it’s not their first choice right
[10/23/24, 10:02:19 PM] Iris Dey: yeah cuz i know ill get my other 2 events cuz of nats
[10/23/24, 10:02:23 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : Because they’re going to get their first choice either way if no one else has a nats qualification
[10/23/24, 10:02:23 PM] Iris Dey: but idk of my 3rd
[10/23/24, 10:02:31 PM] Chin Chin: yeah
[10/23/24, 10:02:33 PM] Iris Dey: kk
[10/23/24, 10:02:39 PM] Chin Chin: i think we leave it to them to figure that out
[10/23/24, 10:02:41 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : Sounds good
[10/23/24, 10:20:10 PM] Chin Chin: video omitted

[10/23/24, 10:58:57 PM] Iris Dey: Wait I have a question whats the system to high-medium-low priority
[10/23/24, 10:59:01 PM] Iris Dey: Just in case someone ask
[10/23/24, 10:59:31 PM] Chin Chin: yeah

[10/23/24, 11:00:12 PM] Chin Chin: sorry
[10/23/24, 11:00:14 PM] Chin Chin: i lagged
[10/23/24, 11:00:33 PM] Chin Chin: basically, low means that there's less teams applying for the event than the limit
[10/23/24, 11:00:45 PM] Chin Chin: medium means that there's just as many or a couple more teams than are allowed
[10/23/24, 11:00:50 PM] Chin Chin: high means that there's definitely too many
[10/23/24, 11:01:00 PM] Iris Dey: Oh okay thanks
[10/23/24, 11:01:09 PM] Chin Chin: that's what you can tell people
[10/23/24, 11:01:10 PM] Iris Dey: There's so many high it's crazy
[10/23/24, 11:01:42 PM] Sanjana: u can thank our 190 person chapter for that

[10/24/24, 4:53:14 PM] Timothy An: Is there any type of candy that we can hand out that won't make a mess and doesn't cause a lot of allergies
[10/24/24, 4:53:40 PM] Timothy An: If kankelborg says she's fine, we can ask in the teams and see what everyone wants too
[10/24/24, 4:54:10 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : Yeah just bring skittles and sour patch
[10/24/24, 4:54:20 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : No allergy no gelatin
[10/24/24, 4:54:30 PM] Timothy An: Ight thatd be best case then
[10/24/24, 4:54:45 PM] Timothy An: I can buy them if needed
[10/24/24, 4:55:32 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : Wait let me check with Ms Ferguson how it’s done
[10/24/24, 4:56:16 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : Ik there’s a reimbursement procedure but I’m going to make sure
[10/24/24, 5:39:09 PM] Timothy An: ight lmk what policy there is but id still be willing to buy the whole club skittles and sour patch without one
[10/24/24, 6:12:49 PM] Cleo Balaranjith: someone put the powerpoint in Teams
[10/24/24, 6:13:06 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: ill do it
[10/24/24, 6:13:17 PM] Iris Dey: Oops
[10/24/24, 6:13:41 PM] Iris Dey: It has nuts
[10/24/24, 6:13:47 PM] Iris Dey: So
[10/24/24, 6:13:52 PM] Iris Dey: I don't think we can
[10/24/24, 6:17:15 PM] Iris Dey: @14255331980 did u ever have a chance to look at shaans email
[10/24/24, 6:17:41 PM] Iris Dey: I think not having a looking for members function is really weighing the solo and duo events volume
[10/24/24, 6:18:06 PM] Iris Dey: Something for next year ofc
[10/24/24, 6:46:05 PM] Cleo Balaranjith: image omitted
[10/24/24, 6:46:10 PM] Cleo Balaranjith: can u fix this
[10/24/24, 6:46:24 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: he can’t register for any more events
[10/24/24, 6:46:25 PM] Iris Dey: Tell Ryan to remove his other event dude
[10/24/24, 6:46:27 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: 5 is the max
[10/24/24, 6:46:37 PM] Cleo Balaranjith: bro hes already in the team
[10/24/24, 6:46:44 PM] Cleo Balaranjith: he has 5 with dvp
[10/24/24, 6:46:52 PM] Cleo Balaranjith: and it wont add him
[10/24/24, 6:46:56 PM] Cleo Balaranjith: add another dude
[10/24/24, 6:46:58 PM] Cleo Balaranjith: shubh
[10/24/24, 6:48:26 PM] Cleo Balaranjith: it does that to brian if i kick ryan out
[10/24/24, 6:48:34 PM] Cleo Balaranjith: and try to add shubh
[10/24/24, 6:50:20 PM] Cleo Balaranjith: wait I FIXED IT
[10/24/24, 6:50:31 PM] Cleo Balaranjith: U NEED TO Un add those people
[10/24/24, 6:50:43 PM] Cleo Balaranjith: and kinda redo the team with those folks at the end
[10/24/24, 6:51:53 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: ok
[10/24/24, 6:52:00 PM] Cleo Balaranjith: its a small bug
[10/24/24, 6:52:09 PM] Cleo Balaranjith: i think most people wont face it
[10/24/24, 6:52:09 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: yeah we can prob fix it
[10/24/24, 6:54:33 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: yeah that's the hope
[10/24/24, 6:59:17 PM] Iris Dey: Kankelborg and Boyd said with the events with a lot of teams filled up the best way to create some typa a quiz (based of the rubric/theme)

She also wants to make it so you have to choose either fbla nats or TSA nats (so like even if u have priority for your event but you choose fbla nats u lose priority, unless another team also rather prefer fbla nats)
[10/24/24, 6:59:23 PM] Iris Dey: Just wanted to let yk
[10/24/24, 7:00:07 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : Yeah that’s why I said
[10/24/24, 7:00:49 PM] Iris Dey: She wants this because she doesn't want the Layla and Arlene case again in nats where Layla didn't go making Arlene go by herself
[10/24/24, 7:01:10 PM] Iris Dey: I think she wants it so more then 50 precent of ur team has to be at TSA nats or smth
[10/24/24, 7:01:24 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: its a little late to add this
[10/24/24, 7:01:29 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: but we can make it part of tomorrows deadline
[10/24/24, 7:01:31 PM] Iris Dey: No this is if
[10/24/24, 7:01:38 PM] Iris Dey: The event
[10/24/24, 7:01:41 PM] Iris Dey: Has too many teams
[10/24/24, 7:01:48 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: yeah yeah ik
[10/24/24, 7:01:54 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: i think interviews are the best way honestly
[10/24/24, 7:02:03 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: and only if there is a pretty big tie
[10/24/24, 7:02:09 PM] Iris Dey: I also agree but Boyd and kankelborg just love test
[10/24/24, 7:02:13 PM] Iris Dey: !
[10/24/24, 7:02:17 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: but someone has to make the tests
[10/24/24, 7:02:21 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: and we don't have experience in these events
[10/24/24, 7:02:27 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : Wait so like you have to choose at the beginning of the year?
[10/24/24, 7:02:51 PM] Iris Dey: It's a would u rather question
[10/24/24, 7:02:55 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : Ohh wait I see
[10/24/24, 7:02:58 PM] Iris Dey: It makes sense kinda
[10/24/24, 7:03:09 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : So like if you went to fbla nats previously, you shouldn’t get priority
[10/24/24, 7:03:12 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : Won’t that be hard to track
[10/24/24, 7:03:17 PM] Iris Dey: No
[10/24/24, 7:03:20 PM] Iris Dey: Not like that
[10/24/24, 7:03:37 PM] Iris Dey: Like if u get both which would u choose type scenario
[10/24/24, 7:03:49 PM] Iris Dey: It would cut down a lot of teams
[10/24/24, 7:04:01 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : It makes sense but idk if it would bring the most honest answets
[10/24/24, 7:04:06 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : Like obviously they’ll say tsa
[10/24/24, 7:04:13 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : Unless there’s an official binding policy
[10/24/24, 7:04:18 PM] Iris Dey: She said after that she will send fbla the info too
[10/24/24, 7:04:35 PM] Iris Dey: So they get less priority in fbla if they choose tsa
[10/24/24, 7:04:35 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : Hm maybe that’s good
[10/24/24, 7:04:39 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : Yeah
[10/24/24, 7:04:59 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: unless we share this data with kaavya
[10/24/24, 7:05:02 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: that's useless
[10/24/24, 7:05:04 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: anyone with half a brain
[10/24/24, 7:05:07 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: will say TSA
[10/24/24, 7:05:11 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : We would have to
[10/24/24, 7:05:12 PM] Iris Dey: Yeah we're going too
[10/24/24, 7:05:24 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: ok
[10/24/24, 7:05:30 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: makes sense
[10/24/24, 7:05:30 PM] Iris Dey: We can haunt them too in the question
[10/24/24, 7:05:38 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: @14253736605 can we implement that
[10/24/24, 7:05:42 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: and then for the tests
[10/24/24, 7:05:44 PM] Iris Dey: Rn?
[10/24/24, 7:05:46 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: we'll do it later
[10/24/24, 7:05:47 PM] Iris Dey: Or later
[10/24/24, 7:05:49 PM] Iris Dey: Kk
[10/24/24, 7:05:50 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: if we determine they're necessary
[10/24/24, 7:05:55 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: rn
[10/24/24, 7:06:07 PM] Iris Dey: Definitely necessary for high volume events
[10/24/24, 7:07:35 PM] Iris Dey: Pranav check teams!!
[10/24/24, 7:08:09 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: doing it
[10/24/24, 7:19:34 PM] Chin Chin: what?
[10/24/24, 7:19:53 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: choosing whether they prefer tsa or fbla nats
[10/24/24, 7:20:13 PM] Chin Chin: I feel like we should leave that for later
[10/24/24, 7:20:21 PM] Iris Dey: Yeah for overfilled teams
[10/24/24, 7:20:21 PM] Chin Chin: a lot of kids don't even know what the clubs are rn
[10/24/24, 7:20:39 PM] Chin Chin: I honestly feel like that's such a paranoid case to look for
[10/24/24, 7:20:54 PM] Chin Chin: let kids make the choices they want, it's their event
[10/24/24, 7:21:14 PM] Chin Chin: if they had the skills to make it to nats, they were most likely the best team to have chosen for that event anyway
[10/24/24, 7:21:20 PM] Iris Dey: But also kankelborg wants it so ppl who are actually committed yk that spot that Layla left could've been given to another well deserving team
[10/24/24, 7:21:46 PM] Iris Dey: She said this
[10/24/24, 7:21:53 PM] Iris Dey: And Boyd and kankelborg really want this
[10/24/24, 7:21:53 PM] Chin Chin: I know
[10/24/24, 7:22:05 PM] Iris Dey: Idk I also think it's valid
[10/24/24, 7:22:15 PM] Chin Chin: I think Boyd wants this cuz of transportation logistics
[10/24/24, 7:22:28 PM] Chin Chin: but that's just my suspicion
[10/24/24, 7:22:36 PM] Chin Chin: I have no issue with adding this feature
[10/24/24, 7:22:51 PM] Iris Dey: I think kankelborg wants all the people possible to get into nats goes to nats yk
[10/24/24, 7:23:02 PM] Iris Dey: Especially the events that are one per chapter
[10/24/24, 7:23:07 PM] Iris Dey: For nationals
[10/24/24, 7:23:36 PM] Chin Chin: I just feel like putting the entire population in that dilemma, when only a small percentage of them are actually going to face it is kinda harmful
[10/24/24, 7:23:47 PM] Iris Dey: Yeah idk
[10/24/24, 7:23:50 PM] Chin Chin: like I know fs that a bunch of kids are gonna start stressing
[10/24/24, 7:23:58 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: yeah
[10/24/24, 7:24:00 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: ik
[10/24/24, 7:24:03 PM] Iris Dey: It's for mainly the events with 14-9 teams yk
[10/24/24, 7:24:04 PM] Chin Chin: and what's to say they don't lie just to get their events?
[10/24/24, 7:24:14 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: cause we ship they to fbla too
[10/24/24, 7:24:16 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: is what they’re saying
[10/24/24, 7:24:19 PM] Iris Dey: Kank is gonna send it to fbla
[10/24/24, 7:24:24 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: i don’t c the point in that
[10/24/24, 7:24:27 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: but ok ig
[10/24/24, 7:24:32 PM] Chin Chin: dude
[10/24/24, 7:24:40 PM] Chin Chin: if the school doesn't stop kids from competing in both
[10/24/24, 7:24:43 PM] Chin Chin: we don't get to either
[10/24/24, 7:24:50 PM] Iris Dey: Yeah ig
[10/24/24, 7:24:57 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: yeah exactly
[10/24/24, 7:25:06 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: i don't c the point in this whole thing
[10/24/24, 7:25:08 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: we can interview them
[10/24/24, 7:25:12 PM] Chin Chin: I just feel like we need to discuss this a little more instead of a day before
[10/24/24, 7:25:12 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: and put it in as a question
[10/24/24, 7:25:14 PM] Iris Dey: Kankelborg was definitely focusing on the events with many people in it
[10/24/24, 7:25:20 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: that carries some but only a little weight
[10/24/24, 7:25:26 PM] Chin Chin: I can reopen the website before the 1st to ask for this if needed
[10/24/24, 7:25:26 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: and i sure as hell ain't trynna design tests
[10/24/24, 7:25:30 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: for things i've never done
[10/24/24, 7:25:34 PM] Iris Dey: Yeah
[10/24/24, 7:25:37 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: or we can make it a forms or smth
[10/24/24, 7:25:42 PM] Chin Chin: she can never guarantee that
[10/24/24, 7:25:55 PM] Iris Dey: Yeah I agree
[10/24/24, 7:26:11 PM] Iris Dey: She just wants "the most committed people"
[10/24/24, 7:26:12 PM] Chin Chin: and there are so many cases in the past where people have had to make that choice, so they add more people to their team who can take care of that event
[10/24/24, 7:26:16 PM] Chin Chin: farad did it
[10/24/24, 7:26:20 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: thats j nonsense
[10/24/24, 7:26:23 PM] Chin Chin: Ricky did it
[10/24/24, 7:26:56 PM] Chin Chin: I honestly don't get why what Layla did was wrong in the first place
[10/24/24, 7:27:09 PM] Chin Chin: by choosing to do that, she compromised her own results at TSA
[10/24/24, 7:27:19 PM] Chin Chin: that's her choice, not ours
[10/24/24, 7:27:22 PM] Iris Dey: Yeah kankelborg felt bad for Arlene
[10/24/24, 7:27:29 PM] Iris Dey: And doesn't want that to happen to other people
[10/24/24, 7:27:48 PM] Chin Chin: does Arlene herself feel bad about the situation?
[10/24/24, 7:27:56 PM] Iris Dey: She did at nats
[10/24/24, 7:28:16 PM] Iris Dey: Kankelborg said "if Layla was to come to TSA nats which she could've they would've made top 10"
[10/24/24, 7:28:29 PM] Iris Dey: Which started this entire argument
[10/24/24, 7:28:39 PM] Chin Chin: I don't buy that
[10/24/24, 7:28:51 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: i think we should talk abt this more
[10/24/24, 7:28:55 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: we don't need the feature for now acc
[10/24/24, 7:28:57 PM] Iris Dey: Yeah definitely
[10/24/24, 7:28:59 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: we can implement that later
[10/24/24, 7:29:02 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: if we think its necessary
[10/24/24, 7:29:09 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: and it can j be a forms
[10/24/24, 7:29:09 PM] Chin Chin: yeah
[10/24/24, 7:29:16 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: FBLA - TSA disclosure form
[10/24/24, 7:29:19 PM] Iris Dey: It's definitely not an everyone situation
[10/24/24, 7:37:57 PM] Iris Dey: Wait what if we do a question like are you doing fbla and/or tsa
[10/24/24, 7:38:01 PM] Iris Dey: Idk
[10/24/24, 7:38:18 PM] Iris Dey: So ppl just doing TSA get a lil more priority in a sense?
[10/24/24, 7:40:05 PM] Cleo Balaranjith: theyll take to much time
[10/24/24, 7:40:10 PM] Cleo Balaranjith: we shud do the quiz thing
[10/24/24, 7:40:20 PM] Cleo Balaranjith: and tell them that they need to learn about thjeir event a lot
[10/24/24, 7:40:25 PM] Cleo Balaranjith: but not directly what to do
[10/24/24, 7:41:24 PM] Cleo Balaranjith: and they should come at like 730 early and do the quiz
[10/24/24, 7:44:15 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : Oh that’s a really good point
[10/24/24, 9:07:42 PM] Cleo Balaranjith: Hello,

[11/3/24, 8:54:54 PM] Cleo Balaranjith: ill ask my group first tho
[11/3/24, 8:55:08 PM] Chin Chin: Most likely, we give webmaster to hem's team and find something else for sophie
[11/3/24, 8:55:18 PM] Chin Chin: because sophie only signed up for webmaster and nothing else
[11/3/24, 8:55:29 PM] Iris Dey: Kankelborg will get very mad if Arlene doesn't get it for some reason
[11/3/24, 8:55:36 PM] Iris Dey: Every time I talk to her
[11/3/24, 8:55:43 PM] Iris Dey: She mentioned webmaster and Arlene
[11/3/24, 8:55:45 PM] Iris Dey: 😭🙏🏽

[11/3/24, 8:56:59 PM] Chin Chin: yeah that's the issue
[11/3/24, 8:57:11 PM] Chin Chin: kank really wants a women-only webmaster team
[11/3/24, 8:57:47 PM] Chin Chin: I would give everyone in arlene's team webmaster over everyone in hem's team in a heartbeat
[11/3/24, 8:57:49 PM] Iris Dey: As a woman they would fight for it fairly
[11/3/24, 8:58:00 PM] Chin Chin: they should
[11/3/24, 8:58:03 PM] Iris Dey: Should*
[11/3/24, 8:58:05 PM] Iris Dey: Yeah
[11/3/24, 8:58:14 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : We can do what works most logically rn and then deal with whatever later
[11/3/24, 8:58:19 PM] Chin Chin: yeah exactly
[11/3/24, 8:58:31 PM] Chin Chin: im sure kankelborg can come to terms with it on her own time
[11/3/24, 8:59:00 PM] Chin Chin: oh one thing to keep in mind here is that sophie's team put this as near-first priority
[11/3/24, 8:59:09 PM] Chin Chin: while hem's team put this is as 3rd
[11/3/24, 8:59:12 PM] Chin Chin: even 4th
[11/3/24, 8:59:32 PM] Chin Chin: if sophie's team gets it, we can ask if they want hem
[11/3/24, 8:59:41 PM] Chin Chin: i doubt they'll say yes, but
[11/3/24, 9:00:10 PM] Iris Dey: Based off our reqs does Arlenes team like beat them
[11/3/24, 9:00:35 PM] Chin Chin: they should
[11/3/24, 9:00:42 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : Wait what was the points
[11/3/24, 9:00:44 PM] Iris Dey: So uh

[11/3/24, 9:00:48 PM] Iris Dey: 😭🙏🏽
[11/3/24, 9:00:55 PM] Chin Chin: both teams have the same score
[11/3/24, 9:01:14 PM] Timothy An: are people allowed to drop events
[11/3/24, 9:01:17 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : Then tech they should get it
[11/3/24, 9:01:29 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : Yes preferably should’ve thought of that before
[11/3/24, 9:01:31 PM] Iris Dey: Wait can you send the master list soon because ppl are texting me how they know what teams to wanna ask to join
[11/3/24, 9:01:32 PM] Chin Chin: yeah sure
[11/3/24, 9:01:40 PM] Chin Chin: but it's stupid af if they do that rn
[11/3/24, 9:01:52 PM] Iris Dey: Wait that made no sense
[11/3/24, 9:01:52 PM] Timothy An: k
[11/3/24, 9:02:06 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : Yeah probably just ask to add hem there
[11/3/24, 9:02:12 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : What about the other 2 webmaster teams
[11/3/24, 9:02:20 PM] Iris Dey: The 1st one is full
[11/3/24, 9:02:24 PM] Chin Chin: one is 2 freshmen
[11/3/24, 9:02:28 PM] Chin Chin: so they don't get it in any world
[11/3/24, 9:02:47 PM] Chin Chin: and the other is a bunch of juniors with some people having only this event
[11/3/24, 9:03:28 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : Oh
[11/3/24, 9:03:38 PM] Iris Dey: Doesn't hem team like all of them have more than 1 event except for him
[11/3/24, 9:03:42 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : Can we not ask teams from any of the other events that hem requested
[11/3/24, 9:03:46 PM] Iris Dey: And like Sophie's everyone has 1
[11/3/24, 9:03:48 PM] Iris Dey: Idk
[11/3/24, 9:04:06 PM] Chin Chin: he only signed up for 2
[11/3/24, 9:04:11 PM] Chin Chin: geospatial and webmaster
[11/3/24, 9:04:12 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : Hem didn’t want webmaster that bad I forgot which one he really wanted was it geospatial
[11/3/24, 9:04:15 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : Oh right
[11/3/24, 9:04:22 PM] Chin Chin: there's no way he's getting geospatial
[11/3/24, 9:04:28 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : Wait then it’s fine if he doesn’t get his choices
[11/3/24, 9:04:34 PM] Chin Chin: yeah
[11/3/24, 9:04:34 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : Because he only signed up for 2
[11/3/24, 9:04:47 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : So we can give another event because there doesn’t seem to be another way
[11/3/24, 9:04:52 PM] Iris Dey: By priority achintya, Sophie's team deserves it
[11/3/24, 9:04:57 PM] Chin Chin: yeah
[11/3/24, 9:04:59 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : Yeah
[11/3/24, 9:05:03 PM] Iris Dey: Lowkey give it

[11/3/24, 9:13:08 PM] Iris Dey: Doesnt make sense
[11/3/24, 9:13:54 PM] Chin Chin: because they had one event only i think
[11/3/24, 9:14:10 PM] Iris Dey: Huh
[11/3/24, 9:14:34 PM] Chin Chin: yeah and they also put it as high priority

[11/3/24, 9:14:51 PM] Iris Dey: Oh yeah I think so
[11/3/24, 10:39:39 PM] Chin Chin: image omitted
[11/3/24, 10:39:55 PM] Chin Chin: even though sanskriti had geospatial quals, she and only one other person did it
[11/3/24, 10:39:59 PM] Chin Chin: and it's a 3-person event
[11/3/24, 10:40:10 PM] Chin Chin: should I say that it's because her qual didn't make 50% of the team size?
[11/3/24, 10:40:36 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: um

[11/4/24, 9:07:43 PM] Iris Dey: Our system was like entirely bias proof
[11/4/24, 9:07:58 PM] Iris Dey: So like we can't do anything
[11/4/24, 9:08:47 PM] Timothy An: if people ask me why they didn't get an event, do i just simply say it was bc of an algorithm and it was the best we could do
[11/4/24, 9:09:59 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: yes technically
[11/4/24, 9:10:01 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: but if they push u

[11/4/24, 9:10:18 PM] ~ Pallavi: image omitted
[11/4/24, 9:10:32 PM] Iris Dey: It's the 50 precent thing

[11/4/24, 9:11:08 PM] Iris Dey: More than 50 percent of your team had to qualify to be counted

[11/6/24, 6:13:02 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : because they should’ve preferably done it before
[11/6/24, 6:13:13 PM] Iris Dey: I think we should just mention it

[11/6/24, 8:26:06 PM] Iris Dey: Science Olympiad has that
[11/6/24, 8:26:17 PM] Iris Dey: So parents get emails about volunteering and stuff

[11/13/24, 5:52:18 PM] Sanjana: i can say "just learn what you've alr learned from class. there will be some specificis"

[11/14/24, 4:11:08 PM] Karma Ibrahim: if like there’s 2 interviews and they are both pretty much equal I think we should check if both members have been coming to meetings regularly or if one of them hasn’t at all then give it to the other person
[11/14/24, 4:11:21 PM] Karma Ibrahim: but other than that i don’t think we’re really keeping track

[11/18/24, 6:19:28 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: Hi all,

The coding test for TSA will take about 30 minutes and will be completed in a proctored environment. Right now, we are planning on doing it during either Wednesday lunch or Thursday lunch. Please let me know as soon as possible if either of these will not work for you. 

I've attached some short bullet points below on what to study:
Memory managed languages
Interpreted languages
Basic coding terminology (modular, immutable/mutable, syntax)
LeetCode/USACO questions because there is one on the test
Again, please let me know if this doesn't work for you as soon as possible. Good luck to all of you!

Sincerely,

Pranav Kannepalli

President, Tesla STEM TSA

[12/8/24, 2:27:48 PM] Iris Dey: Especially from siddharth and siddhesh 😭
[12/8/24, 2:30:35 PM] ~ Cleo: we shud ask kank

[12/8/24, 2:30:55 PM] ~ Cleo: 😂😂
[12/8/24, 2:30:57 PM] ~ Cleo: yeah
[12/8/24, 2:30:59 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : Because it’s due in a bit for her
[12/8/24, 2:31:03 PM] ~ Cleo: the sids are cooked
[12/8/24, 2:31:23 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : We were pretty lenient about the regional fees
[12/8/24, 2:31:31 PM] Iris Dey: Yeah
[12/8/24, 2:31:49 PM] Iris Dey: We should've made it one payment instead of 2 separate ones 😭
[12/8/24, 2:33:09 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : No she has 2 diff payments due and she wanted the exact amounts
[12/8/24, 2:33:14 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : I asked but it’s easier for her

[12/8/24, 2:48:47 PM] Sanjana: my reasoning for letting this slide is bc it’ll mess up the teams if ppl can’t do tsaanymore
[12/8/24, 2:48:58 PM] Sanjana: bc this is like 5+ ppl who forgot to pay
[12/8/24, 2:49:04 PM] Iris Dey: Yeah

[12/9/24, 10:39:16 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: what is with this robotics kids
[12/9/24, 10:39:18 PM] Iris Dey: Bad excuse
[12/9/24, 10:39:20 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: siddesh told me the same thing
[12/9/24, 10:39:31 PM] Iris Dey: Siddharth was gonna tell u the same thing lol
[12/9/24, 10:40:16 PM] Timothy An: and then evan wang had volleyball tournament or wtv and was finalizing a summer mission trip contrast with his church and family so his parents were really caught up on that
[12/9/24, 10:40:36 PM] Iris Dey: Why didn't he email
[12/9/24, 10:40:39 PM] Iris Dey: Pranav
[12/9/24, 10:40:51 PM] Iris Dey: Or like email any board members
[12/9/24, 10:40:55 PM] Iris Dey: 😭😭😭
[12/9/24, 10:41:17 PM] Iris Dey: Like if he cared enough he would've
[12/9/24, 10:41:58 PM] Timothy An: ill respond with what he says
[12/9/24, 11:01:10 PM] Timothy An: Hello, my name is Neel Nevrekar and I have been informed that I was not able to pay for the TSA state qualifier registration. I'd like to first state that I was unable to pay due to my mom currently being in India, meaning my Father and I barely get to talk with her, meaning things such as school payments tend to fall lower on the list. With my mom always handling all my payments, I thus first told my mom about the payment needed for TSA last Monday, thinking that she would complete it. Due to an overnight robotics competition at Ellensburg last Saturday, along with other personal matters I had to attend to, I wasn’t able to communicate with her about this payment any further. This is why when she told me about the website issues she was facing the day after the competition, I immediately emailed Pranav asking him if the payment had gone through, which clearly have not. Just letting the board know about this for further clarification and information.
[12/9/24, 11:01:20 PM] Timothy An: Neels response he texted me
[12/9/24, 11:25:29 PM] Chin Chin: barely get to talk to her?
[12/9/24, 11:25:41 PM] Chin Chin: bruv it's not 1920
[12/9/24, 11:25:47 PM] Chin Chin: you don't have to send long distance pigeons
[12/9/24, 11:25:59 PM] Chin Chin: just call her at 8pm in the night
[12/9/24, 11:26:18 PM] Timothy An: 😂😂😂
[12/9/24, 11:26:46 PM] Timothy An: Do I tell him he's not accepted
[12/9/24, 11:26:51 PM] Chin Chin: idk
[12/9/24, 11:26:57 PM] Chin Chin: up to the rest of the board as well
[12/9/24, 11:26:59 PM] Timothy An: Or wait for pranav
[12/9/24, 11:27:09 PM] Chin Chin: personally idt that's a valid reason
[12/9/24, 11:27:15 PM] Iris Dey: It's mainly kanks
[12/9/24, 11:27:20 PM] Iris Dey: Same
[12/9/24, 11:27:34 PM] Iris Dey: Like let ur dad do the payments instead
[12/9/24, 11:27:38 PM] Iris Dey: Like they both have access
[12/9/24, 11:28:07 PM] Sanjana: mmm hang on I kinda get it
[12/9/24, 11:28:27 PM] Sanjana: my dad would not know dogshit abt the payments i get why this kid had to wait
[12/9/24, 11:29:12 PM] Sanjana: I mean “I couldn’t communicate with her further” is a lame excuse bc ellensburg was like one day 😭
[12/9/24, 11:29:32 PM] Sanjana: Idk I’m hesitant to make kids go this far in the process and then take them out
[12/9/24, 11:29:45 PM] Iris Dey: Same Lowk
[12/9/24, 11:30:05 PM] Chin Chin: my issue is that just cuz you told your parents once to do the payment doesn't mean you've done your part and can just sit back and relax
[12/9/24, 11:30:13 PM] Chin Chin: follow up with them the day after
[12/9/24, 11:30:16 PM] Iris Dey: Yeah 😭
[12/9/24, 11:30:22 PM] Iris Dey: I learnt the hard way
[12/9/24, 11:30:28 PM] Chin Chin: not the day before the payment deadline
[12/9/24, 11:30:34 PM] Timothy An: I'm just worried if people haven't paid their fee in 3 weeks, are they people we wanna keep in the club
[12/9/24, 11:30:51 PM] Timothy An: But then again this is my first year so idk
[12/9/24, 11:30:54 PM] Sanjana: this is fair tbh doesn’t look very good for time management
[12/9/24, 11:31:13 PM] Chin Chin: plus jesus christ dude you're mom's in india
[12/9/24, 11:31:17 PM] Chin Chin: let her enjoy india
[12/9/24, 11:31:21 PM] Iris Dey: 😭😭😭
[12/9/24, 11:31:22 PM] Chin Chin: take responsibility for ur own shit
[12/9/24, 11:31:29 PM] Sanjana: this is also fair 😭😭
[12/9/24, 11:31:38 PM] Sanjana: he could’ve paid with check
[12/9/24, 11:31:43 PM] Chin Chin: or cash
[12/9/24, 11:31:47 PM] Sanjana: yeah
[12/9/24, 11:32:02 PM] Iris Dey: We also mentioned no excuses on this payment
[12/9/24, 11:32:13 PM] Chin Chin: yeah I made it very clear in our meeting
[12/9/24, 11:32:16 PM] Sanjana: And we extended the deadline
[12/9/24, 11:32:30 PM] Iris Dey: Generally its a no
[12/9/24, 11:32:34 PM] Iris Dey: But I feel bad 😭
[12/9/24, 11:32:39 PM] Sanjana: me too
[12/9/24, 11:32:44 PM] Sanjana: I would not be a good lawyer
[12/9/24, 11:32:49 PM] Iris Dey: Same
[12/9/24, 11:32:55 PM] Sanjana: “Your honor he’s just a kid”
[12/9/24, 11:32:57 PM] Timothy An: Let's wait for the others to say their opinions then I guess
[12/9/24, 11:33:08 PM] Sanjana: Yeahh
[12/9/24, 11:33:27 PM] Chin Chin: atp i feel like we should just keep deadlines and act like they're hard deadlines
[12/9/24, 11:33:33 PM] Sanjana: This message was deleted.
[12/9/24, 11:33:40 PM] Chin Chin: but then let kids pay right up until the point
[12/9/24, 11:33:45 PM] Chin Chin: when we literally can't take anymore payments
[12/9/24, 11:33:52 PM] Timothy An: Not paying their fee isn't just a freshman issue though, right? I'm assuming we probably have a lot of others in other grades
[12/9/24, 11:33:54 PM] Chin Chin: better to lead with kindness
[12/9/24, 11:33:54 PM] Sanjana: key word here is act 😭
[12/9/24, 11:34:05 PM] Iris Dey: Yeah def cuz I feel like if we let ppl in, less ppl will start paying on time
[12/9/24, 11:34:06 PM] Timothy An: Cause it matters how many didn't pay as well right?
[12/9/24, 11:34:14 PM] Sanjana: that’s what i’m saying tbh I feel so mean spirited
[12/9/24, 11:34:20 PM] Iris Dey: Yes
[12/9/24, 11:34:21 PM] Sanjana: yes this is probably right
[12/9/24, 11:34:24 PM] Iris Dey: Majority juniors
[12/9/24, 11:34:26 PM] Chin Chin: maybe i just don't have the gut for this
[12/9/24, 11:34:27 PM] Iris Dey: !!!
[12/9/24, 11:34:42 PM] Sanjana: OH I HAVE IDEA
[12/9/24, 11:34:45 PM] Sanjana: ok hear me out
[12/9/24, 11:34:52 PM] Sanjana: ppl who didn’t pay on time, we have a list right
[12/9/24, 11:34:54 PM] Chin Chin: charge him extra
[12/9/24, 11:34:59 PM] Timothy An: Do we know how many people have not paid and what percentage of the club that is
[12/9/24, 11:35:00 PM] Sanjana: put rhem with randos during state
[12/9/24, 11:35:02 PM] Chin Chin: buy the officers donuts
[12/9/24, 11:35:10 PM] Timothy An: 👍
[12/9/24, 11:35:13 PM] Iris Dey: I like this idea
[12/9/24, 11:35:17 PM] Sanjana: pretty sure that’s theft unfortunately
[12/9/24, 11:35:18 PM] Timothy An: Yo what 😭😭
[12/9/24, 11:35:18 PM] Chin Chin: late fee
[12/9/24, 11:35:30 PM] Iris Dey: 5 extra bucks yk
[12/9/24, 11:35:39 PM] Timothy An: Wouldn't they just quit then
[12/9/24, 11:35:40 PM] Chin Chin: for the administrative load it puts on our beloved ms. kankelbrog
[12/9/24, 11:35:44 PM] Timothy An: I would personally
[12/9/24, 11:35:46 PM] Chin Chin: as in rooming
[12/9/24, 11:35:57 PM] Timothy An: Ohh hm
[12/9/24, 11:35:57 PM] Iris Dey: Rooming is not that deep
[12/9/24, 11:35:59 PM] Chin Chin: that's really good to know about you mr. freshman rep
[12/9/24, 11:36:01 PM] Iris Dey: No one's in there room
[12/9/24, 11:36:03 PM] Iris Dey: Half the time
[12/9/24, 11:36:12 PM] Timothy An: YO I DID NOT MEAN IT LIKE THAT 😭😭
[12/9/24, 11:36:21 PM] Chin Chin: lmao i'm playing
[12/9/24, 11:36:28 PM] Chin Chin: i get what you mean
[12/9/24, 11:36:32 PM] Timothy An: Where's the list of people who haven't paid?
[12/9/24, 11:36:37 PM] Iris Dey: I made it
[12/9/24, 11:36:41 PM] Sanjana: yeah it doesn’t cause any harm it’s just mad awkward

[12/9/24, 11:36:49 PM] Iris Dey: Yes
[12/9/24, 11:37:11 PM] Iris Dey: Guys I like sanjanas idea
[12/9/24, 11:37:18 PM] Sanjana: and if they whine abt it be like “you should’ve thought abt that before you paid late 😅😅😂😂🫡😙🙄🤗😊😄”
[12/9/24, 11:37:25 PM] Iris Dey: This is the last time we're accepting late fees tho
[12/9/24, 11:37:27 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : because i feel bad completely rejecting them since they've alr done event registration and there's multiple deadlines

[12/9/24, 11:44:56 PM] Chin Chin: what why
[12/9/24, 11:45:06 PM] Iris Dey: He didn't pay the first fee
[12/9/24, 11:45:11 PM] Iris Dey: And we didn't catch that
[12/9/24, 11:45:13 PM] Sanjana: Bc he didn’t pay the afffiliation fee, we can’t be paying that out of our own pocket
[12/9/24, 11:45:16 PM] Chin Chin: oh yeah
[12/9/24, 11:45:25 PM] Chin Chin: ok yeah somebody email him
[12/9/24, 11:45:35 PM] Sanjana: @14256285458 ?

[12/9/24, 11:48:57 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : Wait so how would he pay now, with a check?
[12/9/24, 11:49:20 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : if so I will wait to email until ms ferguson responds to my email I asked if payment with checks worked
[12/10/24, 7:04:44 AM] Timothy An: @14255153937 guy Segal wants to continue tsa but idt he's realized he hasn't paid
[12/10/24, 7:30:30 AM] Timothy An: While the absence of my payment was undeniably my own fault and responsibility, there were a number of subsequent mishappenings that led to my inability to do so at an earlier date. My life has been especially busy lately, with me finalizing a summer job opportunity in a traveling group of musicians, volleyball tournament prep, and a family emergency. Additionally, with the lack of a TSA meeting, the fees seemed to just fade into the mountain of things I had to do. It was still an error of judgement to not prioritize the impending payments, and I acknowledge that. Despite all these happenings, the main roadblock was undeniably parent communication. My mother's diabetes progressed onto a worse stage, necessitating an almost complete removal of sugar and processed foods from her diet. I (understandably in my opinion) didn't want to necessarily reveal this to other people, and I assumed I could push her to get everything done. However, her energy dropped to a very low level and with judge training for speech and debate, and I wasn't able to get her to. I understand that it was my fault for not preparing ahead of time, but I guarantee you that your grace with this boundary would not be a choice you regret. I can provide a lot of value to my music production team through my 5 years of composing/production experience, 2 year audio engineering mentorship, 7 years of piano, and 3 years of voice experience. I once again apologize for my lapse in judgement and for not prioritizing TSA, and I hope you can understand both my situation and the value I provide.
[12/10/24, 7:30:36 AM] Timothy An: This is Evans message
[12/10/24, 7:32:56 AM] Sanjana: ok the first part reads like chat but I give up, everyone has a family emergency at the exact second they have to pay their fees. which is crude of me to say but this exact scenario has happened like five times now, I say we let it slide
[12/10/24, 7:33:31 AM] Iris Dey: 😭
[12/10/24, 7:37:11 AM] Sanjana: I think we need to start changing the way we give reminders, like lowk do we do 3 teams reminders and then start reminding parents? bc when we send reminders at like 11 am, the kids are like “oh yeah I gotta pay” and then forget abt it by the time they get home, and don’t check teams at home
[12/10/24, 7:37:51 AM] Pranav Kannepalli: fair point
[12/10/24, 7:37:57 AM] Iris Dey: Dude istg we need a parents square set up
[12/10/24, 7:38:03 AM] Pranav Kannepalli: ig we could have kank have parent square

[12/10/24, 7:39:10 AM] Pranav Kannepalli: gawdamn he included his whole resume at the end

[12/10/24, 7:40:04 AM] Iris Dey: It will save us a lot of work during the field trip forms and stuff

[12/10/24, 4:22:58 PM] Iris Dey: to add everyone
[12/10/24, 4:34:37 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: can someone forward these to kankelborg
[12/10/24, 4:35:03 PM] Iris Dey: Forward what
[12/10/24, 4:48:22 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : Like the reasoning?
[12/10/24, 4:48:31 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : Their excuses
[12/10/24, 4:49:27 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: yeah @14256285458 @14255153937 @14256251021 one of you cause ur on the email chain alr

[12/10/24, 5:56:11 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: yeah prob
[12/10/24, 7:08:51 PM] Karma Ibrahim: Guys is it fair if we let some people in and others not. like unless they emailed before the deadline or had like an actual medical or emergency issue they could just be lowkey making things up. I say we charge them a late fee like Sanjana said
[12/10/24, 7:09:34 PM] Karma Ibrahim: What @14256285458 did Ryan get back to you? I think he also got disqualified last year but idk if it was because of late fees
[12/10/24, 7:09:57 PM] Iris Dey: He got dqed cuz he didn't submit anything
[12/10/24, 7:09:59 PM] Iris Dey: 😭
[12/10/24, 7:10:06 PM] Iris Dey: At the state qualifiers
[12/10/24, 7:11:42 PM] Karma Ibrahim: 😭😭
[12/10/24, 7:11:45 PM] Karma Ibrahim: never mind
[12/10/24, 7:12:07 PM] Karma Ibrahim: but what do we feel about cutting out some people and keeping some people? aside from those who emailed obviously
[12/10/24, 7:12:21 PM] Sanjana: the issue is there’s no way to verify anything ppl say, also they’ve come this far i honestly don’t want to take anyone out
[12/10/24, 7:12:50 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : yeah makes sense
[12/10/24, 7:12:52 PM] Sanjana: also this is not what I said lol i think someone else said that, i said the roommates bit
[12/10/24, 7:12:54 PM] Karma Ibrahim: yeah me too that’s why I think keep everyone that’s like emailed and said they want to stay in the club but charge extra
[12/10/24, 7:13:04 PM] Karma Ibrahim: ohhh wait
[12/10/24, 7:13:06 PM] Sanjana: are we allowed to charge extra?
[12/10/24, 7:13:09 PM] Karma Ibrahim: We are doing the roommates thing
[12/10/24, 7:13:10 PM] Sanjana: bc here’s the thing
[12/10/24, 7:13:18 PM] Sanjana: idk if we are, just an idea
[12/10/24, 7:13:23 PM] Karma Ibrahim: Idk to be honest parents might get mad
[12/10/24, 7:13:36 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : Oh that wouldn’t matter
[12/10/24, 7:13:41 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : They didn’t pay the fee on time
[12/10/24, 7:13:45 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : They can pay extra
[12/10/24, 7:13:51 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : It’s just if we’re allowed to
[12/10/24, 7:13:54 PM] Sanjana: imo we go to a school of rich kids, paying 5-10 dollars extra is not gonna be that big of a deal to them
[12/10/24, 7:13:56 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : @14255331980 can I ask?
[12/10/24, 7:14:11 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : exactly
[12/10/24, 7:14:19 PM] Karma Ibrahim: and lowkey we can spend the money on extra funding or something
[12/10/24, 7:14:23 PM] Sanjana: like it gets significant around 20 dollars but at the same time imagine charging 50 dollars for a 30 dollar fee
[12/10/24, 7:14:42 PM] Sanjana: don’t we have a huge excess already
[12/10/24, 7:14:58 PM] Karma Ibrahim: but this time we can spend it lmao
[12/10/24, 7:15:07 PM] Karma Ibrahim: I actually don’t know how much money TSA has
[12/10/24, 7:16:38 PM] Karma Ibrahim: It depends what the others/kank thinks. if we make them pay extra it’s like a reminder for the parents but the kids aren’t affected. However the roommate thing will definitely piss some people off which might be good if we are trying to be like extra strict but also it’s just three days at a hotel
[12/10/24, 7:21:49 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : No and I am emailing Ms. Kankelborg before reaching out to him
[12/10/24, 7:24:54 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : image omitted
[12/10/24, 7:25:00 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : Is this fine?
[12/10/24, 7:25:15 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : I just included the paragraph in case she wanted to read but there’s also a summary
[12/10/24, 7:25:17 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: send Neels again
[12/10/24, 7:25:59 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : image omitted
[12/10/24, 7:26:03 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : This one?
[12/10/24, 7:26:28 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : Also, can I ask about Sanjana’s roommate idea
[12/10/24, 7:26:46 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : For those who didn’t pay
[12/10/24, 7:27:14 PM] Sanjana: if i can make a small edit, ryan chhabra not chabra
[12/10/24, 7:27:21 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : ohh ty
[12/10/24, 7:27:47 PM] ~ Cleo: apparently rohan baliga payed

[12/10/24, 9:26:16 PM] Shruthika Balasubramania : just to see if shes ready to make an exception

[12/14/24, 10:27:45 PM] Timothy An: then she would go look at those who didn't pay and choose individually

Don't cook yourself during finals; we're all experts in procrastination but that doesn't mean you need to prove it. Remember that going to State is an invitation, not a guarantee.

[12/20/24, 11:28:15 AM] Shruthika Balasubramania : every $500 raised donut party every $1000 movie night with snacks?

[12/20/24, 11:28:27 AM] Shruthika Balasubramania : im trying to give incentives
[12/20/24, 12:19:19 PM] Karma Ibrahim: I just talked to Aarushi and she’s saying it’s not a solo event
[12/20/24, 12:19:26 PM] Karma Ibrahim: and that Bhuvan got added to her team
[12/20/24, 1:11:15 PM] Karma Ibrahim: wait I just checked sorry I guess they read it wrong but it’s 3 individuals per chap tree r
[12/20/24, 1:11:17 PM] Karma Ibrahim: Chapter

[12/20/24, 2:50:25 PM] Karma Ibrahim: But priority to aarushi because it was her event
[12/20/24, 2:50:52 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: Bhuvan didn’t sign up for the event
[12/20/24, 2:50:56 PM] Pranav Kannepalli: so i can’t give it to him
[12/20/24, 2:51:28 PM] Karma Ibrahim: Unless bhuvan has 0 events

[12/20/24, 2:54:49 PM] Timothy An: Darren wasn't added to our music production team @14255331980
[12/20/24, 3:11:18 PM] Sanjana: image omitted

[12/20/24, 4:28:46 PM] Timothy An: Can people still drop events?
[12/20/24, 4:29:27 PM] Karma Ibrahim: I mean we can’t really force them to compete and if they don’t submit anything for the Jan deadline they’ll get disqualified either way

[12/22/24, 6:36:59 PM] Sanjana: Jan 23: you submit a project, judges will evaluate it based on their own rubric that isn’t shared. highest scoring entries will be invited to state.  so Jan 23 is the state qual, they’re not two separate events
[12/22/24, 6:37:30 PM] Timothy An: ight thought so
