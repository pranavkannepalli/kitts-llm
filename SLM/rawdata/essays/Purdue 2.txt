Our dinner table conversations have always been dominated by tech. Previously, they were about my parents’ professional projects, but as of late, they’ve centered around the latest AI developments. For me, AI represents a natural extension of my love for both math and computer science. The more I learned about AI, the more I realized how seamlessly it connects 
For the past four years, I’ve actively sought opportunities to dive deeper into AI. It started with building apps that incorporate ChatGPT APIs, projects that would abstract away the complex details but still allow me to interact with AI. From there, it progressed into taking courses that explore the behind-the-scenes workings of models, from activation functions to backpropagation. During my second internship at People Tech Group, I focused on machine learning operations (ML Ops), where I labeled data for production models, wrote scripts to automate the ML pipeline, and conducted data analysis to optimize workflows. This hands-on experience allowed me to learn how to deploy and maintain AI systems in the real world.
AI isn’t just something I study—it's a space I live in daily. Whether it's keeping up with the latest AI advancements or thinking about how to integrate AI into my own projects, I find myself constantly drawn to its evolving potential. As I researched Purdue, I was excited to see AI as a possible major. I am excited to continue exploring AI, as I feel it marries my passion and cultivated skills.
