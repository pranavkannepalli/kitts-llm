Pranav, if you want to survive at this level, you need to start showing some intent.
When my coach barked this reprimand, I knew I was long past my carefree days of playing cricket with friends on a makeshift field, where we could chase after taped tennis balls until sunset without a care in the world. The bowlers I faced in my new leather ball league charged at me with an unfamiliarly fierce intensity. Before I could even register it, the ball flew past me, leaving me frozen at the crease. As I was run off the pitch by superior players, my lungs burned, my legs felt leaden, and I felt lost, uncertain of my own abilities, and terrified that I would be cut from my team and banished from the game I loved.
The next day, I was full of dread before returning to the pitch. My coach introduced a new drill in which he challenged me to anticipate where the bowler would pitch the ball. I found that I consistently predicted the ball’s placement, but I lacked the technique and power to churn out powerful hits. His intervention showed me that my cricketing instinct was sound and that I was cut out for this sport—I just needed to get in better shape and develop my skills.
For months afterward, I began focusing on strength, speed, and agility, arriving at the field early to run, perform push-ups, and do squats and sprints. Over time, my batting and bowling improved significantly. Ultimately, my dedication led to my being named captain of the Seattle U15 team, which traveled to nationals. Without the support of my family and coach, I would have fallen along the wrong side of the fine line between persevering and giving up.
After this experience, I never wanted anyone to fall on the wrong side of that divide, so I started coaching younger players at my local academy. In my players’ struggles—self-doubt, poor fitness, and the temptation to quit—I recognized what had been my own years earlier.
One of my athletes had a sharp cricketing mind and all the right mental attributes, but, despite his skills, struggled to execute in game-time situations. As I observed him during practices and matches, I noticed patterns, especially the hesitations and overthinking in crucial moments. Together, we focused on handling those high-stress moments. I designed drills that recreated game-day conditions, pushing him to stay calm when the match was at stake. We worked on resetting his mindset and helping him focus on the next ball rather than the mistakes he’d made.
As I gained experience, I brought a systematic approach to my coaching, utilizing lessons from my own experience to identify what would help others. For the bowlers, I set up drills focused on consistency and broke down technical errors with video analysis. For the batsmen, we worked on timing and shot selection in scenarios that mirrored match situations. In every session, I emphasized the idea that success was within reach. Through this structured guidance, players began to thrive, with several making the Seattle U13 team and competing nationally. I saw them cross that same line I once did—from nearly quitting to actualizing their potential.
Just as I learned to read bowlers and adjust my strategy, I also learned to understand my students, recognizing what they needed to grow. As a coach, I recognized some players were naturally gifted but lacked the endurance to push through tough situations. Others were underdogs, battling self-doubt but full of potential. My role was to tailor my approach: sometimes offering tough feedback, sometimes being a cheerleader, and often just listening. Growth, whether in sports or academics, isn’t linear; it requires persistence, adapting strategies, and motivation when spirits are low.
These are the qualities I aim to carry into every challenge I face, knowing that, like cricket, life requires both skill and heart.
