At my STEM-centric high school, our curriculum revolves around labs and computer science, with history courses only introduced in junior year, and limited to the essentials for graduation. This focus on STEM has allowed me to immerse myself in both theory and hands-on projects, particularly in Data Structures and Advanced Projects in Java. Because of this foundation, I want to study computer science at the College of Engineering rather than the College of LSA at the University of Michigan because it closely mirrors the STEM-focused education in my high school.
My interest in CS truly ignited once I started applying my skills to real-world projects. While working with a nonprofit in India, I built a website for low-income women to sell handmade products. Despite having to quickly learn to use Google Cloud services for backend development and translation layers for accessibility, it was immensely rewarding to see the platform help women reach a broader audience and gain financial independence. At Michigan, EECS 485: Web Systems will teach me more about full-stack development, database integration, and server management, skills that are crucial in making websites both functional and scalable. I’m also drawn to EECS 497: Human-Centered Software Design and Development, which will refine my focus on creating user-friendly, accessible platforms, ensuring that the websites I build—like the one in India—are intuitive for diverse users. 
Building the website in India led me to seek a deeper understanding of how technology works at a more granular level. So, I approached Krishna Chintalapudi, a Senior Researcher at Microsoft, who helped me work on designing NLP classification techniques using large language models. This challenging endeavor forced me to think beyond just writing code, as I dove into how these models work—understanding the layers, training mechanisms, and optimizations required to interpret language effectively. I now recognize the depth of CS and how much there is still to learn about the technology behind the solutions I create. I’m eager to continue this exploration through the Language and Information Technologies Lab run by Prof. Rada Mihalcea. I hope to collaborate on research in designing LLMs for low-resource languages: work that aligns with my interest in making AI accessible to underrepresented communities.
Moreover, during my internship at Applied Systems, where I was the only high schooler on their AI engineering team and was assigned tasks typically given to engineering graduates. I was given tasks that challenged me beyond my current skill level, such as building a test playground in React to help clients evaluate their services. Although I had limited experience with production APIs and deployment manifests, I was fortunate enough to be surrounded by a supportive community of colleagues who guided me through the fundamentals of Go and Kubernetes. Each new challenge reinforced the idea that coding is about continuous learning and adaptation, principles I have embraced throughout my journey. I am excited about the opportunities at the University of Michigan, where programs like the Michigan Information and Technology Services (ITS) Internship Program will allow me to continue learning while creating projects that showcase my knowledge, all within a supportive network of peers and faculty. 
I truly believe that Michigan’s collaborative and innovative environment will provide the perfect platform for me to continue creating impactful solutions, embodying Michigan’s spirit of serving the greater good.
