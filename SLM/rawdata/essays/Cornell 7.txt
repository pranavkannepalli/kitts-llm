I love the rush from stepping into a test or competition, whether that be an AMC, TSA Nationals, or a big cricket final. Some people hate it, but, for me, it always puts a smile on my face. It's like the moment right before the drop on a roller coaster - an exciting mix of anticipation and nerves. It’s that fluttering feeling in your stomach, the moment where you’re on the edge, ready to dive into the unknown. There’s this focus that kicks in as I brace for the challenge, knowing that once the ride begins, I’ll be fully immersed.
