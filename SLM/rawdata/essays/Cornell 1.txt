I belong to the STEM community, a space where curiosity fuels innovation and learning. As a student, I’ve immersed myself in advanced courses, self-studied coding languages, and tackled projects that challenged my limits and prepared me for real-world applications. But my role in this community extends beyond learning—I’m also a teacher, committed to sharing knowledge with those who lack access. This drive led me to found the Kirkland chapter of Steel City Codes (SCC), which offers free coding lessons to underrepresented kids.
At first, I struggled to connect with my students. My explanations of abstract concepts assumed prior tech knowledge they didn’t have. Realizing this, I redesigned our curriculum to be more engaging and inclusive. I added interactive elements like coding challenges and games and trained instructors to tailor lessons to students’ varying skill levels.
For beginners, we used analogies, like describing a variable as a box that holds information. For advanced learners, we introduced challenge problems to deepen their understanding. The results were transformative. One student, Vishruth, began eagerly anticipating our end-of-day Kahoot quizzes, while another, Mateo, built a prime number finder that exceeded expectations. Watching their confusion turn to excitement was the most rewarding part of my journey with SCC.
The STEM community has also shaped my leadership and mentorship skills. As Technology Student Association president, I’ve coached teams to national success, including two that placed in the top 10 nationally. At Blackwell Elementary, I mentor young math students, helping them excel in competitions while fostering their analytical thinking—a foundation essential for future success.
These experiences have shaped me into a more empathetic and adaptive leader. They’ve deepened my understanding of the challenges others face and the importance of building inclusive spaces. As I look ahead, I’m committed to creating opportunities for underrepresented communities in STEM through both leadership and research. I aim to bridge gaps in communication and education by researching low-resource languages, creating tools that expand access to opportunities for underserved communities. STEM has taught me to lead, learn, and adapt, and I am committed to using these skills to make it accessible to all.
