Last year, I conducted research with Krishna Chintalapudi, a Senior Researcher at Microsoft. Together, we explored NLP classification techniques using LLMs, diving into the intricacies of large language models and how they can be applied to real-world problems. This reinforced my desire to explore AI further at USC through courses like CSCI 544 and CSCI 662. These courses will build on my current understanding by exposing me to cutting-edge topics like machine translation, allowing me to build multilingual AI systems.
I’m also excited to collaborate with Professor Xiang Ren, whose research in commonsense knowledge and graph neural networks aligns with the work I did with Krishna. With him, I hope to do work on LLMs for low-resource languages, expanding the reach of AI services, and making them more equitable and accessible.
During my internship at Applied Systems on their AI Engineering team, I learned how interdisciplinary the study of AI is. On that team, everyone does a little bit of everything, whether it’s web development, data analysis, or backend work. USC’s curriculum mirrors this experience, where I can take courses like PSYC 450 to deepen my understanding of how AI can simulate cognitive and emotional processes alongside my technical skills.
My career goal is to someday launch a tech startup that brings innovative AI solutions to life and makes a lasting impact. USC’s entrepreneurial resources, like the Maseeh Entrepreneurship Prize Competition and Blackstone LaunchPad, will be the perfect tools to help me make my dream a reality.
