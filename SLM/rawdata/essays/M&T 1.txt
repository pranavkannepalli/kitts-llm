Growing up in Redmond, Washington, a tech hub, with parents who are tech veterans, I was immersed in the STEM environment from an early age. My fascination with both mathematics and computer science deepened through advanced coursework and hands-on projects at Tesla STEM High School. However, it was through programs like TiE Young Entrepreneurs and FBLA that I discovered my passion lies at the intersection of business and technology—a space where I can innovate, lead, and create meaningful impact.
As CEO of two mock startups in TiE Young Entrepreneurs, I led teams in developing MVPs for a PDF management system with semantic data extraction and a renting-focused marketplace. These experiences required me to go beyond just coding, as I conducted customer interviews to validate product concepts, designed comprehensive product mockups, and pitched solutions to seasoned industry professionals. Leading these projects helped me improve my ability to identify customer pain points, iterate based on feedback, and communicate technical solutions clearly. Our work resulted in two third-place finishes at the state level and gave me valuable insights into the startup development process. I look forward to building on these skills through M&T’s dual-focus curriculum, especially in courses like OPIM 4150: Product Design and Development and MKTG 2770: Consumer Behavior.
Similarly, my participation in Future Business Leaders of America (FBLA) allowed me to strengthen the bridge between my technical skills and business knowledge. Competing in events like Mobile App Development and Business Calculations, I consistently placed in the top ten at the state level over three years. These experiences taught me how to apply technical skills to solve practical problems. M&T’s cohort-style collaboration and classes like UGBA 151: Management of Technology Innovation will help me further refine these skills while working closely with peers who share my passion for business-engineering synergy.
As an AI Engineering Intern at Applied Systems, I transitioned from working in the structured environment of school projects to addressing the dynamic challenges of the professional world. I worked on creating an AI services showcase app, which involved tasks like editing Kubernetes manifests, building testing pipelines, and developing backend services in Go. I collaborated with Product Management to align my work with the company's broader business goals, addressing critical Errors and Omissions risks caused by AI in the insurance industry. This role taught me to think strategically, manage priorities, and deliver results that directly impact the company’s products. It highlighted the importance of designing technical solutions with business context, a mindset I want to develop further through M&T’s coursework, like MGMT 2300: Entrepreneurship and CIS 4190: Applied Machine Learning.
My independent research under a Microsoft Principal Researcher strengthened my ability to develop practical AI solutions. After experimentation with multimodal RAG, contextual bandits, and LLM distillation, I made the decision to focus on improving LLM accuracy for NLP classification while maintaining cost efficiency. While testing and developing new approaches, I gained valuable insights into creating AI systems that are both computationally efficient and effective. At Penn, I hope to continue this research by working with faculty in the Penn Research in Machine Learning (PRiML) group to develop robust, scalable AI solutions. The M&T program's resources, like the Integrated Product Design Lab, will allow me to bridge this research with business applications, ensuring that the technologies I create are both impactful and viable in the real world.
Ultimately, I envision using the M&T program as a launchpad to build a startup that builds NLP tools for low-resource languages. My goal is to create technologies that address real challenges and provide tangible value to underserved communities. Thus, the interdisciplinary focus of M&T—where every problem is approached through both a technical and business lens—aligns perfectly with my aspirations. I am confident that I will gain the tools, insights, and network to thrive at the intersection of business and technology, enabling me to deliver solutions that make a real impact.
