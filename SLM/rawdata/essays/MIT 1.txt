MIT's research infrastructure makes it ideal for my goal of improving NLP technology for underserved communities. Through CSAIL and the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab, I plan to work with Professor Regina Barzilay on developing more robust multilingual models for low-resource languages like Bengali or Swahili. MIT's SuperUROP program would let me contribute to ongoing research projects, while collaborations with the Media Lab could help ensure these tools reach the communities that need them. MITâ€™s combination of technical learning and social impact perfectly aligns with my vision for more inclusive language technology.
