When I joined Applied Systems as an AI Engineering (AIE) intern, I expected just to be shadowing software engineers (SWEs). At max, I thought I would do some paired programming and contribute maybe 100-200 lines of code. Thus, when I joined my first stand-up, bleary eyed because I woke up at 5:30 for the first time in 2 months, I was shocked to hear that they were trusting me with building an app to showcase all AIE products to clients and partners, a task usually assigned to college graduates or full-time SWEs.
The transition required adapting to Agile development with its two-week sprints, daily 6 AM standups, and regular code reviews â€“ quite different from my school projects. As the project evolved, I found myself working beyond frontend development, diving into Kubernetes manifest files and modifying Go services. The stakes became clear one Friday afternoon when I nearly brought down a production deployment while adjusting these services. Thankfully, my colleagues guided me through enterprise software development best practices, teaching me how to safely modify services and manage deployments.
What started as an unexpected challenge has since become my proudest achievement: instead of the typical high school internship path, I blazed my own trail by taking on graduate-level responsibilities and delivering a product now used across the company, transitioning from theoretical learning to practical application.
