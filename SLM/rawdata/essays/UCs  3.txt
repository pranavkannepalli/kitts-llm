I remember the first time I grasped the power of natural language processing (NLP). In 9th grade, I was toying around with Google Translate when I began wondering how it works. To an end user, it might look simple—type in a sentence, hit enter, and voilà, the machine gives you a translation for any of its 234 languages. I couldn’t help but think, How is this even possible? Language is so messy and full of nuances.
This fascination with language processing resonated with my love for math, which has always been a lens through which I view the world. I often find myself searching for numerical patterns, whether it’s factoring the numbers on street signs or playing “24” with words (where A=1, B=2, and so on). Similarly, NLP utilizes machine translation, which employs statistical models and algorithms to convert language into numerical representations that a machine can understand, before processing it into a different language.
I've approached NLP from multiple angles, combining formal education with hands-on projects. After completing Stanford's NLP course on Coursera, I sought mentorship from Krishna Chintalapudi, a Principal Researcher at Microsoft, to work on improving text classification techniques. But theory alone wasn't enough—I wanted to build. For Technology Student Association competitions, I've integrated NLP into real-world applications, including a sustainable initiatives website with AI-powered suggestions for homeowners. I also developed an app that helps students find college and internship matches using ChatGPT to help generate personalized lessons and tasks.
Yet working on these projects revealed a significant limitation: while there are over 8,000 languages spoken worldwide, most NLP tools support only a fraction of them. Through my work with language models, I've seen how NLP can transform communication, but this transformation isn't equally accessible to all communities, particularly those speaking low-resource languages. This realization has shaped my aspirations. In the future, I hope to found a startup that extends NLP capabilities to low-resource languages, making digital communication tools more inclusive.
