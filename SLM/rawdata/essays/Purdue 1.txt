Math was my first love, enthralling me with its evolving nature and pushing me to think critically. This passion led to Computer Science, where I discovered a similar thrill, with the added benefit of creating solutions that impact people’s lives. While working for a nonprofit in India, I built a website for low-income women to sell their products. I had to quickly learn how to set up Google Cloud service accounts, create translation layers for accessibility, and develop a backend using Google Sheets as a database, ensuring it was user-friendly for a team with no coding experience. Acquiring these new skills, though challenging, was worth it when I witnessed the website reaching a broader audience and allowing these women to gain financial independence. 
Craving a deeper understanding, I pursued research under a Senior Researcher at Microsoft, exploring NLP classification techniques using LLMs. This forced me to think beyond code, diving into the training mechanisms and optimizations behind these models. Being exposed to the depth of CS, I realized how much there remains to learn about the technology behind the solutions I create. 
I further honed my skills during an internship at Applied Systems, where I was the only high schooler on their AI engineering team. I built a test playground in React to help clients evaluate services, working with production APIs and deployment manifests in unfamiliar languages. My colleagues guided me in Go and Kubernetes, reinforcing that coding requires constant learning and adaptation—skills I embraced from the start.
At Purdue, I hope to further explore these challenges, combining my love for math and computer science to create innovative solutions that can make a real-world difference.
