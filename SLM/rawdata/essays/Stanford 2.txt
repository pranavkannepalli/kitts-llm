Hi Roomie,
In the hopes that we’ll build a lifelong relationship this year, let me tell you a little bit about myself.
I’m a diehard cricket fan. Expect to see me shadow batting or doing my bowling action across the room. If you’re up for it, I’d be happy to teach you so we can play a bit between homework. Also, I’m fiercely loyal to the Indian cricket team and Sunrisers Hyderabad, so you’ll catch me staying up late, cheering hard whenever a wicket (out) falls.
Expect 3 or 4 books to always be strewn around the room: one a thrilling Agatha Christie novel, another a book about human psychology, and, of course, a Garfield book. I promise this disorganization is just a part of my creative process.
I’m always down for a conversation, whether it’s about the meaning of life (42), the latest in AI (especially graph RAGs), or just how your day went. Just know, I’m a big fan of spontaneous adventures, so if you ever want to go get a slice from Pizz'a Chicago, hike the Dish Trail, or go fountain hopping around campus, count me in. I’d love to hear about your interests too, whether it’s jamming to Travis Scott, following Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs, checking out local art shows, or anything else.
I’m looking forward to all the memories we’ll make this year—from late-night study sessions and midnight snacks at Lakeside Dining to random moments of laughter in our room.
Sincerely,
Pranav
