I have always loved both math and computer science, and competitions like TSA, AMC 12, and AIME have pushed me to study both while developing my creative problem-solving skills. At Tesla STEM High School, my coursework has challenged me to explore how these disciplines intersect, teaching me how to apply mathematical principles in computer science. At Penn, I am excited to continue this by exploring natural language processing (NLP).
I am eager to build on my high school research, where I developed classification techniques for large language models, and further my NLP knowledge by working with Penn's Cognitive Computation Group and Professor Chris Callison-Burch. I hope to research NLP technologies focused on low-resource languages, using them to enhance AIâ€™s accessibility and ensure diverse voices can participate in our digital future.
However, I believe the humanities are just as crucial to my future goals. Through courses in Penn's College of Arts and Sciences, I can explore the social and cultural dimensions of language and ethics in AI. I plan to combine these insights with Penn's entrepreneurial resources, like Pennovation Works, and utilize my research to found a startup dedicated to working on low-resource languages making our digital future more accessible.
