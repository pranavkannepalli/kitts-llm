Hi Chin Chin,
Some of my best friendships have been forged in competition, but none quite like ours. As I reflect on our years together, I realize I've never properly expressed what our unique friendship has meant to me.
We’ve had our fair share of intense moments, from the Gavaskar-Gavaskar (cause neither of us wants to be Australia) French cricket matches in the hotel room that I always win and the ongoing ping-pong series that used to be my domain until you overtook me. I know you’ll never let me forget that one cricket game in which you got me out, even though I had whacked you in the games before.
Yet, even though we’re sometimes fierce competitors on the field, you’ve also been a constant teammate and confidant. From lifting the Webmaster trophy together in Louisville to competing as part of Tuskers at a cricket tournament in Cali, our friendship has continued to grow. Through it all, you’ve been someone I can count on, whether we’re winning together or pushing each other to be better.
Thanks for being both a competitor and a friend. It’s been a privilege to share both sides of this journey.
Best,
Kittu
