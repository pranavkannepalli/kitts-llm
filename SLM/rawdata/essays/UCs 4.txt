I come from a community rooted in STEM, where learning and teaching go hand in hand. As a student, I’ve challenged myself through advanced courses, national-level math competitions, and self-studying coding languages, preparing me for internships and real-world applications. But my passion extends beyond personal growth; I’m also committed to sharing this knowledge with those who lack equal access, which inspired me to found the Kirkland chapter of Steel City Codes (SCC), offering free coding lessons to underrepresented kids.
Initially, my lessons didn’t land– I was wrongly assuming my students had prior tech knowledge. Recognizing that oversight, I revamped the curriculum, introducing interactive elements like weekly coding challenges and engaging games, and trained my team of volunteers to adapt lessons for varying skill levels. We started with simple analogies for students with no coding knowledge, like explaining a variable as a box that holds information. For more advanced students, we incorporated challenge problems alongside each concept to deepen their understanding. 
The results were transformative. One student, Tommaso, began eagerly anticipating our daily Kahoot games, while another student, Mateo, who initially struggled to write basic commands, took his Python learning beyond classes and developed a text-based adventure game. Witnessing their journey from confusion to enthusiasm became my most rewarding experience.
My commitment to STEM education continues beyond SCC. As president of the Technology Student Association (TSA), I've transformed our chapter by implementing a peer mentorship system where experienced members guide newcomers through technical challenges. This approach has yielded impressive results, as multiple teams secured top-10 finishes at last year’s national conference.
At Blackwell Elementary, I coach students through complex math problems, helping them develop problem-solving skills and competition readiness. The effort from the mentors has paid off as our students have gone on to win multiple awards at state competitions. More importantly, I've watched students grow from being intimidated by complex problems to confidently tackling new mathematical challenges.
The ripple effects, from nationally recognized projects to elementary students discovering their love for mathematics, demonstrate how targeted educational support can transform individual opportunities into community-wide advancement.
