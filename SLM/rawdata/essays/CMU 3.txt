For me, a successful college experience means acquiring the skills and knowledge to make meaningful contributions to the field of AI while creating impactful solutions for underrepresented communities. Carnegie Mellon University’s rigorous academic environment and focus on innovation make it the ideal place to realize this vision.
CMU’s robust computer science program excites me, especially courses like 11-711: Algorithms for NLP and 11-744: Question Answering and Dialogue Systems, which align with my passion for low-resource language processing. These courses will help me build upon my high school NLP research and internship experiences, where I developed classification techniques for LLMs. At CMU, I aspire to expand these efforts by working with faculty like Professor Graham Neubig, whose research on multilingual NLP and transfer learning for low-resource languages aligns with my goal of bridging language barriers. His work inspires me to explore how NLP can empower communities worldwide, whether through improved translation systems or accessible AI tools.
Beyond coursework, CMU’s focus on interdisciplinary collaboration is deeply appealing. The Language Technologies Institute and its emphasis on both theoretical and applied AI will provide me with opportunities to engage in cutting-edge research. I’m particularly drawn to the CMU AI Mentorship Program, where I can collaborate with peers and mentors on impactful projects. This will prepare me for my ultimate goal of founding an AI startup focused on low-resource languages, leveraging CMU's Swartz Center for Entrepreneurship for guidance and resources.
A successful college experience is also about balance and personal growth. CMU’s vibrant cricket culture offers the perfect outlet for me to stay active and connect with fellow students. Competing with international peers will remind me of the resilience and teamwork I’ve cultivated through years of playing cricket. At CMU, I hope to merge technical excellence with personal fulfillment, equipping myself to leave a lasting impact on the world.
