My high school journey in STEM has been shaped by hands-on learning, teamwork, and growth as both a student and mentor. Attending a STEM-focused school, I’ve learned the value of collaboration through hackathons and TSA competitions. These experiences have shown me the importance of balancing my ideas with others to drive innovation.
At Applied Systems, as the only high schooler on the AI engineering team, I experienced a supportive and collaborative environment. My colleagues were generous with their time and knowledge, helping me grow quickly despite my inexperience. This culture of openness reinforced my belief that progress in STEM comes from collective effort and shared learning.
As much as I am a student, I’m also a teacher and a mentor. I founded the Kirkland Chapter of Steel City Codes, where I teach coding to underrepresented children. Much like at Applied Systems, I’ve worked to create a supportive environment where students can learn at their own pace and feel encouraged to ask questions. My goal is to instill in them the same sense of curiosity and resilience that has driven my own journey, showing them that they, too, can make an impact in the tech world.
At USC, I plan to apply my diverse STEM experiences by actively contributing to both research and outreach. I aim to join the USC Viterbi School of Engineering's STEM Education Outreach to mentor K-12 students, drawing from my work at Steel City Codes to organize inclusive coding workshops that empower underrepresented students. I’m eager to engage in cutting-edge research, leveraging my skills in AI and natural language processing, and contribute to group projects by bringing the collaborative mindset I developed at Applied Systems. Additionally, I plan to tutor my peers in coding through the Engineering Student Council, as teaching has always deepened my understanding while fostering collaboration. By blending research, mentorship, and outreach, I hope to contribute to a culture of innovation and inclusion at USC.
