I come from a community rooted in STEM, where learning and teaching go hand in hand. As a student, I've challenged myself through advanced courses, national-level math competitions, and self-studying coding languages, preparing me for internships and real-world applications. But my passion extends beyond personal growth; I'm committed to sharing knowledge with those who lack equal access, which inspired me to found the Kirkland chapter of Steel City Codes (SCC), offering free coding lessons to underrepresented kids.
Initially, my lessons didn't resonate â€“ I was wrongly assuming students had prior tech knowledge. After recognizing this oversight, I revamped the curriculum with interactive elements and trained volunteers to adapt lessons for varying skill levels. Starting with simple analogies for beginners, like explaining variables as boxes holding information, while offering challenge problems for advanced students, we saw transformative results. One student, Tommaso, went from reluctant participant to eager learner, while Mateo progressed from struggling with basic commands to developing his own text-based adventure game. Their journey from confusion to enthusiasm became my most rewarding experience.
At CMU, I'm especially excited to contribute to CMU CS Academy, a platform I've experienced firsthand as a student. Having benefited from its well-structured Python curriculum, I'm eager to help enhance and develop new content that can reach even more students nationwide. Through the Leonard Gelfand Center's K-12 outreach initiatives, I plan to create additional support systems for schools adopting CS Academy, drawing from my experience with both sides of the platform to make computer science education more accessible and engaging.
Additionally, I hope to work with CMU's Computer Science Pathways program, which connects local high school students with undergraduate mentors. By sharing my experiences and knowledge, I can help inspire the next generation of Pittsburgh's tech innovators while contributing to CMU's mission of fostering inclusive technical education in our community.
