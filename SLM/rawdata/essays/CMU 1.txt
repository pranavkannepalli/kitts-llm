I remember the first time I grasped the power of natural language processing (NLP). In 9th grade, I was toying around with Google Translate when I began wondering how it works. To an end user, it might look simple—type in a sentence, hit enter, and voilà, the machine gives you a translation for any of its 234 languages. I couldn't help but think, How is this even possible? Language is so messy and full of nuances.
This fascination resonated with my love for math—I find myself searching for numerical patterns, whether factoring street numbers or playing "24" with words (where A=1, B=2, and so on). Through NLP, I discovered how computers could transform language into mathematical representations, combining my love of patterns with real-world impact.
My passion grew through hands-on projects. After completing Stanford's NLP course on Coursera, I sought mentorship from Krishna Chintalapudi, a Principal Researcher at Microsoft, to improve text classification techniques. For Technology Student Association competitions, I integrated NLP into real-world applications, including a sustainable initiatives website with AI-powered suggestions for homeowners. I also developed an app that helps students find college and internship matches using ChatGPT to generate personalized lessons and tasks.
But what truly cemented my decision to major in Computer Science was discovering NLP's limitations: while over 8,000 languages exist worldwide, these tools support only a small fraction. Through my work with language models, I've seen how computer science can transform communication, but this transformation remains inaccessible to many communities, particularly those speaking low-resource languages. 
Thus, I plan to use my Computer Science education to found a startup extending NLP capabilities to low-resource languages, making digital communication tools truly inclusive. For me, CS isn't just a major—it's a path to ensuring no community gets left behind in our digital future.
