There are 8324 registered languages in the world. Google Translate currently supports 234. In the future, I hope to help bridge this gap by creating translation technology for low-resource languages, which are rarer and, hence, have less training data for AI models. UIUCâ€™s computer science program will help me achieve this by giving me a deeper understanding of AI and NLP technologies through courses like CS 441 and CS 447. I am hoping to take these alongside LING 406, PSYC 433, and other interdisciplinary courses that will help me combine my understanding of human language and linguistics with my technical skills. I also hope to take advantage of UIUC's entrepreneurial resources, such as the Technology Entrepreneur Center, to gain mentorship and networking opportunities. This will help bring my ideas for low-resource language translation to life, thereby empowering communities that are often left behind in the tech world.
