Iâ€™ll be the first to recognize myself as an introvert. I love that side of me and can sit for hours coding or reading alone. However, in junior year, I recognized the need to develop my public speaking and leadership skills.
Thus, I made the tough decision to run for Washington TSA State Office and, initially, I struggled. Presenting to large audiences felt overwhelming, but I was determined to grow. With the help of my state officer coach Rishita, I was able to branch out of that shell and, eventually, deliver a speech to 1,600 people - a milestone that once seemed impossible.
Though I didn't win, I gained invaluable confidence in not only my public speaking abilities but also my ability to push myself beyond my comfort zone. I enter college with both resilience and willingness to adapt, knowing I can challenge myself to overcome intimidating obstacles.
