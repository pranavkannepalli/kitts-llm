Math was my first love, captivating me with its evolving nature, pushing me to think critically. This passion led to Computer Science, where I discovered a similar thrill, with the added benefit of creating solutions that impact people’s lives. While working for a nonprofit in India, I built a website for low-income women to sell their products. I learned how to set up Google Cloud service accounts, created translation layers for accessibility, and developed a backend using Google Sheets as a database. Witnessing the website reach a broader audience and help women gain financial independence solidified my passion for using technology to make a tangible difference in the world.
Craving understanding, I pursued research under a Principal Researcher at Microsoft, exploring NLP classification techniques using LLMs. This experience pushed me to think beyond code, diving into the training mechanisms and optimizations behind these models. I realized how much more there is to learn about AI, machine learning, and the technology behind the systems we build, reinforcing my commitment to studying Computer Science.
I further honed my skills during an internship at Applied Systems. I was entrusted with building a test playground in React to help clients evaluate the AI Engineering team’s services. Working with unfamiliar production APIs and deployment manifests, I relied on colleagues to guide me through the basics of Go and Kubernetes. This experience reinforced my belief that coding is about constant learning and adaptation—skills I’ve embraced from the beginning.
With the increase of AI, I hope to found a startup that builds LLMs for low-resource languages to give voice to different communities within AI applications and extend accessibility to a more diverse population. Studying computer science will provide the technological foundation needed to bridge my intellectual curiosity, innovative spirit, and desire to create a lasting societal impact.
