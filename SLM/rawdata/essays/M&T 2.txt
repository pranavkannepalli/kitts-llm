In my 11th grade summer, I worked with Jnana Prabodhini, an Indian NGO, on their Stree Shakti Prabodhan ("Women Empowerment") project. Traveling through rural villages outside Pune, I interviewed 60 women entrepreneurs whose determination was remarkable.
I met women who wove sarees using techniques learned from their mothers. Others were entrepreneurs running small but efficient kitchen businesses making traditional local dishes and local artisans working with simple materials. One woman's story stood out: despite never receiving a formal education, she had developed a keen business sense and used a  microfinance loan to establish a hotel strategically located on a busy travel route through rural Pune. Thus, she took herself from doing household duties and surviving on a dollar a day to becoming her family's breadwinner.
However, as I listened to these women, a critical problem became evident: despite their exceptional skills, they lacked access to clients. Local sales were limited, and connecting with larger businesses or international clients seemed impossible. Thus, I decided to create a custom-made website catalog and resource planning platform.
I focused on making the website accessible, implementing translation layers and simplifying data entry by using an untraditional Google Sheets backend. I took initiative in advertising the website both to companies in India and at local festivals back home. Within six months of launching the website, 40 of the 60 businesses saw a significant increase in orders, with some experiencing up to 200% growth, giving these women entrepreneurs visibility, stability, and hope.
