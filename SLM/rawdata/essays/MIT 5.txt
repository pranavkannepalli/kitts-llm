When I founded the Kirkland chapter of Steel City Codes (SCC), a nonprofit offering free coding education to underrepresented students, I faced a series of unexpected challenges that tested my resolve. My initial outreach to schools was met with rejection. Undeterred, I pivoted to a grassroots approach, contacting local libraries, community centers, and parents directly.
Once I assembled my first class, a new challenge emerged: my lessons weren’t landing. I had assumed students possessed basic tech knowledge and designed the curriculum accordingly, but this proved incorrect when students struggled with fundamental concepts like variables and syntax, leaving them confused and disengaged.
Thus, I revamped the curriculum entirely. I introduced interactive coding challenges and simple analogies, like explaining variables as “boxes” that hold information. I also trained volunteers to adapt lessons for students at different levels, providing challenge problems for advanced learners and extra support for beginners.
The impact was transformative. Mateo progressed from struggling with basic commands to creating a text-based adventure game, while Tommaso, who initially showed little interest, began eagerly participating in our coding games. Over the past two years, SCC Kirkland has grown to serve over 60 students, many of whom entered with no coding experience but left with tangible skills and confidence.
This experience taught me the importance of questioning assumptions, adapting to challenges, and persisting in the face of setbacks.
