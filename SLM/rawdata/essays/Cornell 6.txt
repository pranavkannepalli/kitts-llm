At Cornell, I plan to contribute by fostering cross-disciplinary innovation, particularly at the intersection of engineering, technology, and community-driven initiatives. Beyond just taking Computer Science classes, Iâ€™m excited to branch out into fields like linguistics and cognitive science to enhance my understanding of Natural Language Processing (NLP). By combining knowledge from multiple disciplines, I aim to build more inclusive and impactful AI solutions. This broader perspective will allow me to develop tools that are not only technically advanced but also mindful of the cultural and linguistic nuances that influence language technology. I look forward to engaging with peers and professors to explore innovative solutions that transcend traditional boundaries.
