This year, I interned at Applied Systems, an insurance-tech company, as the only high schooler on their AI Engineering (AIE) team. Taking on the responsibilities of a software engineer, I was tasked with building a test playground in React to help clients evaluate the team’s services. One Friday afternoon, I nearly broke the production deployment for one of their services as I was editing it to work with my website. Fortunately, my colleagues guided me through the fundamentals of Go and Kubernetes, helping me adapt quickly and saving me from becoming “that intern”. Each new challenge I faced, reinforced that coding is about continuous learning and resilience, principles I’ve embraced throughout my journey. After weeks, I completed and presented the website to the Senior Vice President overseeing Software Engineering, a moment that showed me the real-world impact of the project I had built. This experience solidified my passion for CS.
