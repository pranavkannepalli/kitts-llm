This year I had the opportunity to intern at Applied Systems on their AI Engineering Team, which was pivotal for my growth because it immersed me in a professional software development environment, transitioning me from theoretical learning to real-world application. Taking on responsibilities typically assigned to college graduates, such as building a test playground and modifying production services in Go, challenged me to adapt quickly and learn new skills. I gained hands-on experience with Agile methodologies, Kubernetes, and systems architecture while navigating deployment failures. This internship shaped me into a confident and capable engineer ready for future challenges.
