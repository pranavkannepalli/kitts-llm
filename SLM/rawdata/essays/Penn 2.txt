As much as I'm a student, I'm also a teacher. This belief inspired me to found the Kirkland chapter of Steel City Codes (SCC) to teach coding to underrepresented children.
With SCC, I developed a curriculum tailored to students' diverse skill levels, introducing interactive elements like weekly coding challenges and games to spark engagement. Initially, I assumed students had prior tech knowledge, but after realizing the gaps, I adapted the curriculum and trained my volunteers to tailor lessons to different skill levels. For beginners, I used analogies like comparing variables to boxes that hold information, while for advanced students, I incorporated challenge problems to deepen their understanding. Collaborating with local schools and community groups, I reached a broad audience, ensuring everyone has the opportunity to explore the tech field.
At Penn, I'm excited to continue this commitment through programs like Mathmates, which offers math tutoring to underserved middle and high school students. I'm also drawn to Access Engineering and PESTLE, where I can contribute to Pennâ€™s community by inspiring future generations in STEM.
In turn, Penn will challenge me to innovate as I engage with its community. Together, we can build a more inclusive future, one student at a time.
