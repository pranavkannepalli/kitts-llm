I remember discovering the power of natural language processing (NLP) in 9th grade while using Google Translate. To an end user, it seemed simpleâ€”type a sentence, hit enter, and get a translation. I wondered, *How is this even possible? Language is so messy and full of nuances.*
My love for math provided a lens to understand this complexity. I often search for numerical patterns, like factoring street sign numbers or playing "24" with words (where A=1, B=2). Similarly, NLP uses statistical models to convert language into numerical representations a machine can understand.
This led me to seek the mentorship of Krishna Chintalapudi, a Principal Researcher at Microsoft, with whom I worked on classification techniques using large language models (LLMs). This experience opened my eyes to the intricacies of language processing and the potential to model the subtleties of human expression.
My exploration exposed a critical limitation: while 8,324 languages exist worldwide, Google Translate supports only 234. This disparity became a driving force for my future goals, as I aspire to develop techniques that incorporate low-resource languages into digital platforms, breaking down communication barriers and ensuring diverse voices can participate in the global conversation.
