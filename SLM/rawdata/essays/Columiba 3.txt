For me, a successful college experience means developing the technical and leadership skills to advance AI to aid underrepresented communities. Columbia’s rigorous academics and focus on societal impact make it the perfect place to achieve this vision.
Columbia’s Computer Science program excites me, especially courses like COMS W4705 Natural Language Processing and COMS 4772 Advanced Machine Learning, which align with my passion for low-resource language processing. These courses will build on my high school NLP research, where I developed classification techniques for LLMs. I’m eager to conduct research into low-resource languages through collaborations with Columbia’s Data Science Institute and projects within the Columbia Center of AI Technology, translating this work into solutions that bridge language barriers.
Beyond academics, I hope to join the Columbia Artificial Intelligence Club and continue playing high-level cricket with the Columbia Cricket Club, which will allow me to grow as both a leader and teammate.
