As much as I am a student, I’m also a teacher. My passion for technology led me to pursue internships and research opportunities that sharpened my problem-solving skills, but I believe knowledge is most powerful when shared. This belief inspired me to found the Kirkland chapter of Steel City Codes (SCC) to teach coding to underrepresented children.
At SCC, I developed a curriculum that emphasizes hands-on learning through engaging projects and designed workshops that introduce fundamental programming concepts, allowing students to create their own applications and games. By fostering an interactive learning environment, I encouraged creativity and critical thinking while making coding accessible to all participants. Moreover, I collaborated with local schools and community organizations to reach a diverse range of students, ensuring that everyone has the opportunity to explore the tech field.
At Stanford, I’m eager to expand this commitment to diversity and inclusion in tech by working with programs like Stanford Step-Up, which offers tutoring to middle and high school students, and the Center for Teaching and Learning for peer tutoring. I plan to use my experience with SCC to build workshops and mentorship programs that empower underrepresented students in STEM. I also look forward to collaborating with peers and faculty in Stanford’s Centers for Equity, Community, and Leadership, where I can support initiatives that promote diversity in technology.
By engaging with Stanford’s intellectual community, I hope to inspire others while contributing to a culture that values inclusion, creativity, and innovation.
