Cornell Engineering offers the precise resources I need to advance my goal of expanding NLP for low-resource languages. The computer science and electrical engineering programs provide hands-on research opportunities in machine learning with courses like CS 4780 (Machine Learning). The Cornell Tech ecosystem, particularly the Jacobs Technion-Cornell Institute, focuses on applied technology that could support my startup vision. Research groups like the Natural Language Processing group, led by professors who specialize in computational linguistics, would provide mentorship for developing translation technologies for underrepresented languages. Additionally, programs like the Mondavi Social Venture Challenge could help me refine the entrepreneurial framework for my proposed NLP accessibility initiative.
