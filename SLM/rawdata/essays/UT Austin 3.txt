My journey in computer science began with a love for mathematics. Since second grade, I’ve competed in math competitions, from the North South Foundation to AMC 12 and AIME. This exposure taught me to thrive in a challenging environment and how to learn on the fly, but it also gave me a community to lean on. This was most evident when I attended the AwesomeMath program, which is designed for students like me—those who thrive on challenges and want to enhance their competitive math abilities. Engaging in collaborative problem-solving with peers from around the globe sharpened my analytical skills and fostered a critical-thinking mindset essential for computer science. This blend of collaboration, competition, and intense learning set the stage for my later ventures into computer science, particularly my involvement in TSA (Technology Student Association).
In TSA, I found an environment that mirrored the challenges of AwesomeMath, where I could apply my mathematical problem-solving skills to real-world technology projects. This past year,  I collaborated with teammates to build a website that advertises sustainable solutions to homeowners in addition to an app that offers high school students the opportunity to connect with peers, colleges, and companies, both of which went on to place top 10 at Nationals. During the development process for the website, we encountered a significant bug in our backend AI services that caused the website to crash right before the submission. Debugging this issue was daunting and required long hours of trial and error. However, through teamwork and persistent communication, we identified the problem and implemented a fix. For me, this reinforced the value of collaboration and mentorship in problem-solving, especially in tech projects.
Looking for a mentor to guide my future projects, I found Krishna Chintalapudi, a senior researcher at Microsoft, who guided me through research on NLP classification using LLMs. As I delved into the intricacies of neural network architectures, such as transformers and recurrent neural networks, I often felt overwhelmed by the complexity. To navigate this, I broke down each challenge into smaller, more manageable parts, starting from familiar ground—whether mathematical concepts or foundational coding principles. I would then expand my understanding through online resources or Krishna’s guidance. Under his mentorship, I not only gained hands-on experience with cutting-edge NLP technologies but also built a project that I am proud of. This experience cemented my passion for AI and computer science, fueling my ambition to study these fields in college and eventually explore how AI can be applied to solve real-world problems.
Currently, I intern at Applied Systems, where I am the only high schooler on the AI engineering team, taking on tasks typically assigned to full software engineers. One of my main responsibilities was building a test playground in React for clients to evaluate the AI team’s services. Despite my limited experience with production APIs and deployment manifests, I quickly recognized the importance of learning from the team around me. Working closely with experienced engineers, I often engaged in pair programming or sought their advice on more complex tasks. With their support, I learned the fundamentals of Go and Kubernetes, and through this collaborative environment, I was able to successfully complete my project. This experience solidified my belief that problem-solving is not just about individual effort, but also about tapping into the collective expertise of a team to overcome challenges efficiently and learn continuously.
I believe that Turing Scholars will provide me with the ideal platform to continue growing, as it will connect me with like-minded students who thrive in rigorous environments, where it is expected to challenge conventional boundaries. I know the collaboration with peers and professors will help me form a supportive, tight-knit community that encourages growth and innovation. By leveraging the benefits of the Turing Scholars program, I hope to found a startup that builds LLMs for low-resource languages to give voice to different communities within AI applications and extend accessibility to a more diverse population. Turing Scholars will provide the technological foundation and community I need to bridge my intellectual curiosity, innovative spirit, and desire to create a lasting societal impact.
