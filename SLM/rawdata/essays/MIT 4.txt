During my summer with Jnana Prabodhini, an Indian NGO, I collaborated with 60 women entrepreneurs in rural villages outside Pune to bridge the gap between their exceptional skills and market opportunities. These artisans created beautiful traditional goods – from hand-woven sarees to local delicacies – yet struggled to reach customers beyond their villages.
Working alongside these entrepreneurs, I learned about their businesses, challenges, and aspirations. One woman's journey particularly inspired me: using a microfinance loan, she built a successful hotel on a rural route despite lacking formal education. Through our conversations, I discovered that despite their determination and skill, these women faced a common barrier: limited market access.
Together, we developed a solution. I created a website catalog and resource planning platform, while the women provided crucial input on their needs and challenges. I focused on accessibility, implementing translation features and a simple Google Sheets backend that the women could easily manage. They taught me about their crafts and business practices, while I shared digital skills and market connections.
Our collaboration yielded remarkable results. Within six months, 40 businesses saw orders increase by up to 200%. More importantly, we created a sustainable platform for economic empowerment, giving these talented entrepreneurs the visibility and opportunities they deserved. Through this experience, I learned that the most impactful solutions emerge when we work together, combining diverse perspectives and skills.
