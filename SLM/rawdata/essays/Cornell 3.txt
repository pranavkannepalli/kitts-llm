Winning 1st place in the Webmaster competition at TSA Nationals in 2023 was a defining moment for me, as it tested and showcased my skills in web development, UX/UI design, and teamwork. Our challenge was to create a fictional space tourism website, which required balancing creativity with technical precision under strict guidelines. Competing involved rigorous evaluations, interviews, and live assessments against the nationâ€™s best teams. This achievement reinforced my confidence in problem-solving under pressure and leading a team toward a shared goal. It also solidified my passion for creating impactful digital solutions, a principle I strive to carry forward.
