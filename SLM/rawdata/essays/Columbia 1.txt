As much as I’m a student, I’m also a teacher. This belief inspired me to found the Kirkland chapter of Steel City Codes (SCC) to teach coding to underrepresented children. 
With SCC, I developed a curriculum that emphasizes hands-on learning through engaging projects and designed workshops that introduce fundamental programming concepts, allowing students to create their own applications and games. By fostering an interactive learning environment, I encouraged creativity and critical thinking while making coding accessible to all participants. Moreover, I collaborated with local schools and community organizations to reach a diverse range of students, ensuring that everyone has the opportunity to explore the tech field.
Teaching has not only enabled me to share my knowledge but has also deepened my understanding. I’m eager to continue this work at Columbia through programs like Sci-Inspire and Columbia University Competitions in Math, mentoring young learners and making STEM more inclusive.
