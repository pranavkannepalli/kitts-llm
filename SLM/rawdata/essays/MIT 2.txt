I still remember my first cricket game. It was on a makeshift field with friends back when we were just chasing taped tennis balls till sunset without a care in the world. Since then, I’ve developed what can only be called a cricket fever. I’ve captained cricket teams at national tournaments in California and Houston, with many of those same friends by my side, and, when that wasn’t enough, I began coaching at the local academy. I watch the sport endlessly with my dad, spending hours together in the night discussing India’s test match strategy against Australia. I even found a way to play it in the hotel room with my friends, as together we invented a new version just so that I could squeeze that much more out of the sport. I love the sport that much and I hope to continue it wherever I go.
