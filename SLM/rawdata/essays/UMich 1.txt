I belong to the STEM community. As a student, I’ve taken advanced courses and self-studied coding languages, diving into projects that pushed my limits and prepared me for internships and real-world applications. But just as important, I’m also a teacher, passionate about sharing what I’ve learned with those who don’t have equal access. This inspired me to found the Kirkland chapter of Steel City Codes (SCC), which offers free coding lessons to underrepresented children.
Initially, my lessons didn’t land. I was explaining abstract concepts, wrongly assuming my students had prior tech knowledge. Recognizing that oversight, I revamped the curriculum, introducing interactive elements, including weekly coding challenges and engaging games. I also trained my team of instructors to adapt lessons for varying skill levels. 
We started with simple analogies for students with no coding knowledge, like explaining a variable as a box that holds information. For more advanced students, we incorporated challenge problems alongside each concept to deepen their understanding. Soon, there was a shift in my students' attitude: from confusion to enthusiasm. One student, Vishruth, would eagerly wait for the end-of-day Kahoot, and another student, Mateo, coded a prime number finder, exceeding expectations. Watching this transformation was the most rewarding part of my journey with SCC.
I continue to share my STEM knowledge in other parts of my life. As Technology Student Association president, I’ve coached teams to national success, watching with pride as two teams achieved top-10 finishes. At Blackwell Elementary, I guide young students through complex math problems, not only helping them excel in competitions but also building a foundation for analytical thinking, which is essential for future success. 
I envision a world where STEM education is equitable, where opportunities are within everyone's reach, and I'm committed to making that a reality—one student at a time.
