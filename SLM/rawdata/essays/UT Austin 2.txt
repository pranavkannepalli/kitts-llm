The world I belong to is surrounded by technology. Dinner table conversations are about the newest apps my parents are working on and my most meaningful experiences have been tech-related internships and research that force me to problem-solve and think critically. Wanting to expose others to a similar learning environment, I founded the Kirkland chapter of Steel City Codes (SCC), which teaches coding to underrepresented kids.
Initially, my lessons didn’t land. I was explaining abstract concepts, wrongly assuming all my students had prior tech knowledge. Recognizing that oversight, I revamped the curriculum, introducing interactive elements, including weekly coding challenges and engaging games. I also trained my team of instructors to cater to every student’s knowledge level. 
For students with no coding knowledge, we started with simple analogies, like explaining a variable as a box that holds information. For those with some previous knowledge, we incorporated challenge problems alongside each concept to deepen their understanding. Soon, there was a shift in my students' attitude: from confusion to enthusiasm. One student, Vishruth, would eagerly wait for the end-of-day Kahoot, and another student, Mateo, surpassed our expectations by applying the skills we taught to code a prime number finder. Watching this transformation was the most rewarding part of my journey with SCC.
I continue to share my knowledge in other parts of my life. As TSA president, I’ve coached teams to national success, watching with pride as two teams achieved top-10 finishes. At Blackwell Elementary, I guide young students through complex math problems, not only helping them excel in competitions but also building a foundation for analytical thinking, which is essential for future success. 
I envision a world where STEM education is equitable, where opportunities are within everyone's reach, and I'm committed to making that a reality—one student at a time.
