Math was my first love, enthralling me with its evolving nature and pushing me to think critically. This passion led to Computer Science, where I discovered a similar thrill, with the added benefit of creating solutions that impact people’s lives. While working for a nonprofit in India, I built a website for low-income women to sell their products. I had to quickly learn to set up Google Cloud service accounts, create translation layers for accessibility, and develop a backend, ensuring it was user-friendly for a team with no coding experience. Acquiring these complex skills was worthwhile when I witnessed the website reaching a broader audience and making these women financially independent.
Craving a deeper understanding, I worked under a Senior Researcher at Microsoft, exploring NLP classification techniques using LLMs. Thinking beyond code, I dove into the training mechanisms and optimizations behind these models. Being exposed to the depth of CS, I realized there remains much to learn about the technology behind the solutions I create.
Georgia Tech’s cutting-edge research environment is the ideal place for me to continue this journey. With my background in NLP,  I’m eager to collaborate with Professor Wei Xu in her innovative work in document-guided instruction with LLMs. My internship at Applied Systems in their AI Engineering department provided me with valuable knowledge of both software and AI development, highlighting the interdisciplinary nature of CS. Tech’s emphasis on multidisciplinary collaboration within the Intelligence thread at the College of Computing mirrors this experience. I’m excited to study math and CS along with cognitive sciences and psychology, which are crucial for understanding the various applications of computational intelligence.
Finally, Tech’s commitment to entrepreneurship with programs like CREATE-X inspires me to one day found a startup, creating technology that positively impacts those that are underrepresented.
