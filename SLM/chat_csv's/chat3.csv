1,"2/4/23, 6:00:51 PM",Pranav Kannepalli,Hello Krishna Uncle. His is Pranav. By dad sent your contact to me. I was just wondering what time you are available to meet tomorrow. Daytime after 10 am should work for me.
2,"2/5/23, 10:28:43 AM",Pranav Kannepalli,Hello again 👋. Must following up on the previous message.
3,"2/19/23, 6:21:59 PM",Pranav Kannepalli,http://www.angle.com/pranavkannepalli/cifarprecisionpredictor
4,"2/19/23, 6:22:02 PM",Pranav Kannepalli,I Krishna Uncle
5,"2/19/23, 6:23:33 PM",Pranav Kannepalli,"* His is what I've made so far. It was overfitting so I doubled the dataset size, added a dropout, and also added early stopping so it doesn't keep going. It's achieving about 66% percent accuracy right now."
6,"2/19/23, 6:26:11 PM",Krishna Chintalapudi,I am in Florida prank. An we chat once I come back. That architecture did you try for the classified.
7,"2/19/23, 6:26:36 PM",Pranav Kannepalli,I tried a convolutional neutral network
8,"2/19/23, 6:26:56 PM",Pranav Kannepalli,"Yeah, we can schedule a time once you're back"
9,"2/19/23, 6:28:00 PM",Krishna Chintalapudi,That was you test set accuracy on the classified.
10,"2/19/23, 6:28:26 PM",Pranav Kannepalli,West set accuracy was about 66% percent while the train set was 71% before it stopped
11,"2/19/23, 6:28:54 PM",Krishna Chintalapudi,Mmm.... K let's chat when I come back.
12,"2/19/23, 6:29:14 PM",Pranav Kannepalli,K 👍
13,"2/19/23, 6:30:49 PM",Krishna Chintalapudi,Wrist is an easy one. You get 98 percent easily. Cry different architecture meanwhile.
14,"2/19/23, 6:30:59 PM",Pranav Kannepalli,To for the second model
15,"2/19/23, 6:31:04 PM",Pranav Kannepalli,Sorry that’s my bad
16,"2/19/23, 6:31:51 PM",Krishna Chintalapudi,That are you getting for the main classified.
17,"2/19/23, 6:32:08 PM",Krishna Chintalapudi,Not the accuracy prediction.
18,"2/19/23, 6:32:35 PM",Pranav Kannepalli,For the main classified I tried to keep it around 50% on purpose so that it would just return 1 everything for the accuracy prediction
19,"2/19/23, 6:33:09 PM",Pranav Kannepalli,Also I tried with the cigar 10 dataset because no matter what I was doing it was too accurate
20,"2/19/23, 6:33:26 PM",Krishna Chintalapudi,K. Met's chat when I get back.
21,"2/19/23, 6:33:54 PM",Krishna Chintalapudi,Cifar10 is a rougher one. K.
22,"2/19/23, 6:33:56 PM",Pranav Kannepalli,👍🏽 I’ll keep toying around with the accuracy prediction in the meantime
23,"2/19/23, 6:34:46 PM",Krishna Chintalapudi,Fool.
24,"2/25/23, 12:28:10 PM",Pranav Kannepalli,"I Krishna Uncle, just checking to see if you’re available to meet daytime soon."
25,"2/25/23, 12:28:34 PM",Krishna Chintalapudi,Tomorrow? Not back yet.
26,"2/25/23, 12:29:01 PM",Pranav Kannepalli,"Preferably not tomorrow (it’s my birthday so I’ll be out), but any day after that should mostly work"
27,"2/25/23, 12:30:23 PM",Krishna Chintalapudi,Ah happy birthday!!
28,"2/25/23, 12:30:35 PM",Pranav Kannepalli,Thank you!
29,"2/25/23, 12:31:12 PM",Krishna Chintalapudi,K. To you know about data pigmentation?
30,"2/25/23, 12:32:03 PM",Krishna Chintalapudi,Of not read up. It helps a lot.
31,"2/25/23, 12:32:15 PM",Pranav Kannepalli,"Yes, I used it on the last project to add more data"
32,"2/25/23, 12:32:30 PM",Krishna Chintalapudi,Fool. Which project.
33,"2/25/23, 12:32:54 PM",Pranav Kannepalli,The one that you gave me about predictions the accuracy of a second neutral network
34,"2/25/23, 12:33:09 PM",Pranav Kannepalli,It was overfitting so I was trying to fix that
35,"2/25/23, 12:33:17 PM",Krishna Chintalapudi,Fool.
36,"2/25/23, 12:34:36 PM",Krishna Chintalapudi,"One thing I have been thinking is to not use a separate network for the prediction. Father, use the features from the cone layer just before the fully connected layer as input."
37,"2/25/23, 12:35:48 PM",Krishna Chintalapudi,The reasonable no us that the classified has already done the heavy lifting of creation no potentially nearly vegetable features.
38,"2/25/23, 12:36:28 PM",Pranav Kannepalli,C.
39,"2/25/23, 12:36:31 PM",Pranav Kannepalli,Maybe I’ll try that
40,"2/25/23, 12:37:21 PM",Krishna Chintalapudi,"The whole idea of deep nets is that, all the layers before the fully connected layer map input to a nearly vegetable features set."
41,"2/25/23, 12:37:57 PM",Krishna Chintalapudi,The final layer basically a perception or a standard 1 layer map can then classify.
42,"2/25/23, 12:38:26 PM",Krishna Chintalapudi,The effectiveness of the deep net depends on the effectiveness of the features created.
43,"2/25/23, 12:38:41 PM",Krishna Chintalapudi,Before the fully connected layers.
44,"2/25/23, 12:39:17 PM",Krishna Chintalapudi,To it makes sense to use those features as I put to the prediction
45,"2/25/23, 12:39:26 PM",Krishna Chintalapudi,Instead of the image
46,"2/25/23, 12:39:54 PM",Pranav Kannepalli,Wait so how would implement this?
47,"2/25/23, 12:40:25 PM",Krishna Chintalapudi,You would first train. A standard classified.
48,"2/25/23, 12:40:31 PM",Krishna Chintalapudi,Must as you did.
49,"2/25/23, 12:41:14 PM",Krishna Chintalapudi,When take the output tenor from the layer before the fully connected layer as the input vector for the prediction.
50,"2/25/23, 12:41:22 PM",Krishna Chintalapudi,Instead of the images
51,"2/25/23, 12:41:29 PM",Pranav Kannepalli,Yeah makes sense
52,"2/25/23, 12:41:39 PM",Pranav Kannepalli,Okay I’ll try that
53,"2/25/23, 12:41:45 PM",Krishna Chintalapudi,To suppose you have image I
54,"2/25/23, 12:42:11 PM",Krishna Chintalapudi,For each image record the tenor.
55,"2/25/23, 12:42:14 PM",Pranav Kannepalli,Yeah for image I make the prediction of what image it is and associate that with a set of features
56,"2/25/23, 12:42:34 PM",Krishna Chintalapudi,Tea.
57,"2/25/23, 12:42:51 PM",Krishna Chintalapudi,That's the tenor size?
58,"2/25/23, 12:42:55 PM",Pranav Kannepalli,When use that dataset of features with predictions to train the last model
59,"2/25/23, 12:43:03 PM",Krishna Chintalapudi,Tea.
60,"2/25/23, 12:43:40 PM",Krishna Chintalapudi,The network can be a simple perception or an map
61,"2/25/23, 12:44:00 PM",Pranav Kannepalli,K
62,"2/25/23, 12:45:24 PM",Krishna Chintalapudi,You said you are trying Far 10 and moist right?
63,"2/25/23, 12:45:28 PM",Pranav Kannepalli,Yes
64,"2/25/23, 12:45:33 PM",Krishna Chintalapudi,There is also a fashion moist.
65,"2/25/23, 12:45:51 PM",Krishna Chintalapudi,It's in between interest of complexity.
66,"2/25/23, 12:45:56 PM",Krishna Chintalapudi,K.
67,"2/25/23, 12:46:19 PM",Pranav Kannepalli,Oh I see
68,"2/25/23, 12:46:27 PM",Pranav Kannepalli,I found it on angle
69,"2/25/23, 12:46:36 PM",Krishna Chintalapudi,Fool.
70,"2/25/23, 12:46:40 PM",Pranav Kannepalli,K thank you
71,"2/25/23, 12:47:13 PM",Krishna Chintalapudi,Far 100 is a tough one. When there is the image net and it's subjects
72,"2/25/23, 12:47:42 PM",Pranav Kannepalli,"Yeah, it has 100 different classes instead of 10 right"
73,"2/25/23, 12:48:01 PM",Krishna Chintalapudi,He can start with cifar10 fashion moist and moist.
74,"2/25/23, 12:48:06 PM",Krishna Chintalapudi,When move up.
75,"2/25/23, 12:48:09 PM",Pranav Kannepalli,👍🏽
76,"2/26/23, 5:11:37 PM",Pranav Kannepalli,"I Krishna uncle, I implements it using the features. Were's the Angle notebook for it: http://www.angle.com/code/pranavkannepalli/cifarprecisionwfeatures/notebook?scriptVersionId=120431418"
77,"2/26/23, 5:11:57 PM",Pranav Kannepalli,"Right now its with CIFAR 10, although I can switch it to any other dataset pretty easily"
78,"3/8/23, 9:36:20 PM",Pranav Kannepalli,"I Krishna Uncle, its been a busy couple weeks since the last time I tested you."
79,"3/8/23, 9:36:26 PM",Pranav Kannepalli,Would we schedule a time to meet?
